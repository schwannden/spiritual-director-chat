# BOOK THREE:

## Chapter 25: The Basis Of Firm Peace Of Heart And True Progress

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, I have said: "Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you."34 All men desire peace but all do not care for the things that go to make true peace. My peace is with the humble and meek  of heart: your peace will be in much patience. If you hear Me and follow My voic e, you will be able to enjoy much peace.

THE DISCIPLE

What, then, shall I do, Lord?

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

Watch yourself in all things, in what you do and what you say. Direct your every intention toward pleasing Me alone, and desir e nothing outside of Me. Do not be rash in judging the deeds and words of others, and do not ent angle yourself in affairs that are not your own. Thus, it will come about t hat you will be distur bed little and seldom.

34John 14:27.

Yet, never to experience any disturbance or  to suffer any hurt in heart or body does not belong to this present life, but rather to the state of eternal  rest. Do not think, therefore, that you have found true peace if you feel no depression, or t hat all is well because you suffer no opposition. Do not think that all is perfect  if everything happens just as you wish. And do not imagine yourself  great or consider yourself especially beloved if you are filled with great devotion and sweetness. For the true lover of virtue is not known by these things, nor do the progre ss and perfection of a man consist in them.

THE DISCIPLE

In what do they consist, Lord?

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

They consist in offering yourself with all your heart to the divine will, not seeking what is yours either in small matters or great ones, either in  temporal or eternal things, so that you will preserve equanimity and give  thanks in both prosperity and adversity, seeing all things in their proper light.
If you become so brave and long-sufferi ng in hope that you can prepare your heart to suffer still more even when all inwa rd consolation is withdrawn, and if you do not justify yourself as t hough you ought not be made to suffer such great things, but acknowledge Me to be just in all My wo rks and praise My holy name -- then you will walk in the true and right path of peace, then you may have sure hope of seeing My face again in joy. If you attain to comple te contempt of self, then know that you will enjoy an abundance of peace, as much as is possible in this earthly life.
