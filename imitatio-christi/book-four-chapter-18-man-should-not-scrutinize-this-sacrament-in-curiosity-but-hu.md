# BOOK FOUR: 

## Chapter 18: Man Should Not Scrutinize This Sacrament In Curiosity , But Humbly Imitate Christ And Submit Reason To Holy Faith

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
BEWARE of curious and vain examination of this most profound Sacrament, if you do not wish to be plunged into the depths of doubt. He who scrutinizes its majesty too closely will be overw helmed by its glory. 
God can do more than man can understand . A pious and humble search for truth He will allow, a search that  is ever ready to learn and that seeks to walk in the reasonable doctrine of the fathers. 
Blest is the simplicity that leaves the di fficult way of dispute and goes forward on the level, firm path of God' s commandments. Many have lost devotion because they wished to search into things beyond them. 
Faith is required of you, and a sincere life,  not a lofty intellect nor a delving into the mysteries of God. If you neither k now nor understand things beneath you, how can you comprehend what is above you? Submit yourself to God and humble reason to faith, and the light of underst anding will be given you so far as it is good and necessary for you. Some are gravely tempted conc erning faith and the Sa crament but this disturbance is not laid to  them but to the enemy. 
Be not disturbed, dispute not in your mind, answer not the doubts sent by the devil, but believe the words of God, believe His saints and prophets and the evil enemy will flee from you. It is  often very profitable for the servant of God to suffer such things. 
For Satan does not tempt unbelievers and sinners whom he already holds securely, but in many ways he does tempt and trouble the faithful servant. 
Go forward, then, with sincere and unflin ching faith, and with humble reverence approach this Sacrament. Whatever you c annot understand commit to the security of the all-powerful God, Who does not deceive you. The m an, however, who trusts in

himself is deceived. God walks with sincere men, reveals Himself to humble men, enlightens the understanding of  pure minds, and hides His grace from the curious and the proud. 
Human reason is weak and can be deceive d. True faith, however, cannot be deceived. All reason and natural science ought to come afte r faith, not go before it, nor oppose it. For in this most holy and supremel y excellent Sacrament, faith and love take precedence and work in a hidden manner. 
God, eternal, incomprehensible, and infinitely powerful, does great and inscrutable things in heaven and on earth, and there is no searching into His marvelous works. If all the works of God were such  that human reason could easily grasp them, they would not be called wonderful or beyond the pow er of words to tell.
