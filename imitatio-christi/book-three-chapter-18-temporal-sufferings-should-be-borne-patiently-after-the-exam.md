## Chapter 18: Temporal Sufferings Should Be Borne Patiently , After The Example Of Christ

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, I came down from heaven fo r your salvation and took upon Myself your miseries, not out of necessity but out of  love, that you might learn to be patient and bear the sufferings of this life without repining. From the mom ent of My birth to My death on the cross, suffering did not leave Me. I su ffered great want of te mporal goods. Often I heard many complaints against Me. Disgrace and reviling I bore with patience. For My blessings I received ingratitude, for My miracles blasphemies , and for My teaching scorn.

THE DISCIPLE

O Lord, because You were patie nt in life, especially in fulfilling the design of the Father, it is fitting that I, a most miserable sinner, should liv e patiently according to Your will, and, as long as You shall wish, bear the burden of this corruptible body for the welfare of my soul. For though this present life seems burdensome, ye t by Your grace it becomes meritorious, and it is made brighter  and more endurable for the weak by Your example and the pathways of the saints. But it  has also more consolation than formerly under the old law when the gates of heaven we re closed, when the way thereto seemed darker than now, and when so few cared to seek the eternal kingdom. The just, the elect, could not enter heaven before Your  sufferings and sacred death had paid the debt.
Oh, what great thanks I owe You, Who have shown me and all the faithful the good and right way to Your ever lasting kingdom! Your life is our way and in Your holy patience we come nearer to You Who ar e our crown. Had You not gone before and taught us, who would have cared to follow? Alas, how many would have remained far behind, had they not before their eyes Your holy example! Behold, even we who have heard of Your many miracles and teachings are still lukewarm; what would happen if we did not have such light by which to follow You?
