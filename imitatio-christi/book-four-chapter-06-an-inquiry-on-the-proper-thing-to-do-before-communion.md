## Chapter 6: An Inquiry On The Proper Thing To Do Before Communion

THE DISCIPLE

Place before me some short exercise suitable for Holy Communion, for it is good to  know in what manner I ought to make my heart ready devoutly and fervently for You, to receive Your Sacrament for the good of my soul, or even to celebrate so great and divine a sacrifice.
