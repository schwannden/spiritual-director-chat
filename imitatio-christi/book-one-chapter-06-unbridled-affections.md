## Chapter 6: Unbridled Affections

WHEN a man desires a thing too much, he at once becomes ill at ease. A proud and avaricious man never rests, whereas he w ho is poor and humble of heart lives in a world of peace. An unmortified man is quickl y tempted and overcome in small, trifling

evils; his spirit is weak, in a measure carnal and inclined to sensual things; he can hardly abstain from earthly desires. Hence it  makes him sad to fo rego them; he is quick to anger if reproved. Yet if he satisfies his desires, remorse of conscience overwhelms him because he followed his passions and they did not lead to the peace he sought. 
True peace of heart, then, is found in resi sting passions, not in satisfying them. 
There is no peace in the carnal man, in the m an given to vain attractions, but there is peace in the fervent and spiritual man.
