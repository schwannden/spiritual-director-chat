# BOOK THREE: 

## Chapter 1: The Inward Conversation Of Christ With The Faithful Soul

I WILL hear what the Lord God will speak in me."24 Blessed is the soul who hears the Lord speaking within her, who receives the word of consolation from His lips. Blessed ar e the ears that catch t he accents of divine whispering, and pay no heed to the murmurings of this world. Blessed indeed are the ears that listen, not to the voice which sounds without, but to the truth which teaches within. Blessed are the eyes which are cl osed to exterior things and are fixed upon those which are interior. Blessed are they who penetrate inwardly, who try daily to prepare themselves more and more to under stand mysteries. Blessed are they who long to give their time to God, and who cut themselves off from the hindrances of the world. 
Consider these things, my soul, and close the door of your senses, so that you can hear what the Lord your God speaks within you. "I am your sa lvation," says your Beloved. "I am your peac e and your life. Remain with Me and you will find peace. 
Dismiss all passing things and seek the eter nal. What are all temporal things but snares? And what help will all creatures be able to give you if you are deserted by the Creator?" Leave all these things, therefore, and make yourself pleasing and faithful to your Creator so that you may attain to true happiness.
