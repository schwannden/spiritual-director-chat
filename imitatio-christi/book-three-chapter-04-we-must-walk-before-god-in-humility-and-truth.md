# BOOK THREE: 

## Chapter 4: We Must Walk Before God In Humility And Truth

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
MY CHILD, walk before Me in truth, and s eek Me always in the simplicity of your heart. He who walks before Me in truth s hall be defended from the attacks of evil, and the truth shall free him from seducers and fr om the slanders of wicked men. For if the truth has made you free, then you shall be fr ee indeed, and you shall not care for the vain words of men. 
 
THE DISCIPLE  
 
O Lord, it is true. I ask that it be with me  as You say. Let your truth teach me. Let it guard me, and keep me safe to the end. Let it free me from all evil affection and badly ordered love, and I shall walk with You in great freedom of heart. 
 
THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
I shall teach you those things which are right and pleasing to Me. Consider your sins with great displeasure and sorrow, and never think yourself to be someone because of your good works. You are truly a sinner. You are subject to many passions and entangled in them. Of yourself you always tend to nothing. You fall quickly, are quickly overcome, quickly troubled, and quickl y undone. You have nothing in which you can glory, but you have many things for whic h you should think yourself vile, for you are much weaker than you can comprehend. Hence, let none of the things you do seem great to you. Let nothing seem important or precious or desi rable except that which is everlasting. Let the eternal truth please you above all things, and let your extreme unworthiness always displease you. Fear nothing, abhor nothing, and fly nothing as you do your own vices and sins; these should be more unpleasant for you than any material losses. 
Some men walk before Me without sincerit y. Led on by a certain curiosity and arrogance, they wish to know My secrets and to understand the high things of God, to the neglect of themselves and their own salvation. Through their own pride and curiosity, and because I am against them, such men often fall into great temptations and sins. 
Fear the judgments of God! Dread the wrath of  the Almighty! Do not discuss the works of the Most High, but examine your sins -- in what serious things you have offended and how many good things you have neglected. 
Some carry their devotion only in books, so me in pictures, some in outward signs and figures. Some have Me on their lips when ther e is little of Me in their hearts. Others, indeed, with enlighten ed understanding and purified affections, constantly long for everlasting things; they are unwilling to hear of earthly a ffairs and only with reluctance

do they serve the necessities of nature. T hese sense what the Sp irit of truth speaks within them: for He teaches them to despise earthly things and to love those of heaven, to neglect the world, and each day and night to desire heaven.
