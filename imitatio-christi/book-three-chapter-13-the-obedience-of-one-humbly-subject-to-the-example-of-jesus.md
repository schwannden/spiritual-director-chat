# BOOK THREE:

## Chapter 13: The Obedience Of One Humbly Subject To The Example Of Jesus Christ

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, he who attempts to escape obeying withdraws himself from grace.
Likewise he who seeks private benefits for hi mself loses those which are common to all.
He who does not submit hims elf freely and willingly to his s uperior, shows that his flesh is not yet perfectly obedient but that it often rebels and murmurs against him.
Learn quickly, then, to submit yourself to  your superior if you wish to conquer your own flesh. For the exterior enemy is mo re quickly overcome if the inner man is not laid waste. There is no more troublesom e, no worse enemy of the soul than you yourself, if you are not in ha rmony with the spirit. It is absolutely necessary that you conceive a true contempt for yourself if you wish to be vi ctorious over flesh and blood.
Because you still love yourself too inordinat ely, you are afraid to resign yourself wholly to the will of others . Is it such a great matter if you, who are but dust and nothingness, subject yourself to  man for the sake of God, when I, the All-Powerful, the Most High, Who created all thi ngs out of nothing, humbly s ubjected Myself to man for your sake? I became the most humble and the lowest of all men that you might overcome your pride with My humility.
Learn to obey, you who are but dust! Learn to humble yourself, you who are but earth and clay, and bow down under the foot of every man! Learn to break your own will, to submit to all subjection! Be zealous  against yourself! Allow no pride to dwell in you, but prove yourself so humble and lowly that all may walk over you and trample upon you as dust in the streets!
What have you, vain man, to complain of? What answer can you make, vile sinner, to those who accuse you, you w ho have so often offended God and so many times deserved hell? But My eye has spared you because your soul was precious in My sight, so that you might know  My love and always be thankful for My benefits, so that you might give yourself continually to tr ue subjection and humility, and might patiently endure contempt.
