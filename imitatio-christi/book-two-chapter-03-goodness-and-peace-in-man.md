## Chapter 3: Goodness And Peace In Man

FIRST keep peace with yourself; then you will be able to bring peace to others. A peaceful man does more good than a learned man. Whereas a passionate man turns even good to evil and is quick to believe ev il, the peaceful man, being good himself, turns all things to good.
The man who is at perfect ease is nev er suspicious, but the disturbed and discontented spirit is upset by many a suspicion. He neither rests himself nor permits others to do so. He often says what ought not to be said and leaves undone what ought to be done. He is concerned with the dut ies of others but neglects his own.
Direct your zeal, therefore,  first upon yourself; then y ou may with justice exercise it upon those about you. You are well versed in  coloring your own actions with excuses which you will not accept from others, though it would be more  just to accuse yourself and excuse your brother. If you wish men to  bear with you, you mu st bear with them.
Behold, how far you are from true charity and humility which does not know how to be angry with anyone, or to be indignant save only against self!
It is no great thing to associate with t he good and gentle, for such association is naturally pleasing. Everyone enjoys a peacef ul life and prefers persons of congenial habits. But to be able to live at peace wit h harsh and perverse men, or with the undisciplined and those who irritate us, is a great grace, a prai seworthy and manly thing.
Some people live at peace with themselv es and with their fellow men, but others are never at peace with themselves nor do they  bring it to anyone else. These latter are a burden to everyone, but they are more of a burden to themselves. A few, finally, live at peace with themselves and try to  restore it to others.
Now, all our peace in this miserable life is found in humbly enduring suffering rather than in being free from it. He who kn ows best how to suffer will enjoy the greater peace, because he is the conqueror of himself, the master of the wo rld, a friend of Christ, and an heir of heaven.
