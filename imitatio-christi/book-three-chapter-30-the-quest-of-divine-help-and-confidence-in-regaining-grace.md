## Chapter 30: The Quest Of Divine Help And Confidence In Regaining Grace

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, I am the Lord Who gives strengt h in the day of trouble. Come to Me when all is not well with you. Your tardiness in turning to prayer is the greatest obstacle to heavenly consolation, for before you pray  earnestly to Me you first seek many comforts and take pleasure in outward things. T hus, all things are of little profit to you until you realize that I am t he one Who saves those who trust in Me, and that outside of Me there is no worth-while help, or any  useful counsel or lasting remedy.
But now, after the tempest, ta ke courage, grow strong once more in the light of My mercies; for I am near, says the Lord, to restore all things not only to the full but with abundance and above measure. Is anything diffi cult for Me? Or shall I be as one who promises and does not act? Where is your faith? Stand firm and persevere. Be a man of endurance and courage, and consolation will come to you in due time. Wait for Me; wait -- and I will come to heal you.
It is only a temptation that troubles you,  a vain fear that terrifies you.
Of what use is anxiety about the future? Does it bring you anything but trouble upon trouble? Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. It is foolish and useless to be either grieved or happy about future things which perhaps may never happen. But it is human to be deluded by such imaginations, and t he sign of a weak soul to be led on by suggestions of the enemy. For he does not care whether he overcomes you by love of the present or fear of the future.
Let not your heart be troubled, therefore, nor let it be afraid. Believe in Me and trust in My mercy. When you th ink you are far from Me, then often I am very near you.
When you judge that almost all is lost, then very often you are in the way of gaining great merit.
All is not lost when things go contra ry to your wishes. You ought not judge according to present feelings, nor give in to any trouble whenever it co mes, or take it as though all hope of escape were lost. And do not consider yourself forsaken if I send some temporary hardship, or withdraw the cons olation you desire. For this is the way to the kingdom of heaven, and without doubt it is bette r for you and the rest  of My servants to be tried in adversities than to have all things as you wish. I know your secret thoughts, and I know that it is profitable fo r your salvation to be left sometimes in despondency lest perhaps you be puffed up by success and fancy yourself to be what you are not.

What I have given, I can take away and re store when it pleases Me. What I give remains Mine, and thus when I take it away I take nothing that is yours, for every good gift and every perfect gift is Mine.
If I send you trouble and adversity, do not fret or let your heart be downcast. I can raise you quickly up again and turn all your sorro w into joy. I am no less just and worthy of great praise when I deal with you in this way.
If you think aright and view things in their true light, you should never be so dejected and saddened by adversity, but rather rejoice and give thanks, considering it a matter of special joy that I afflict you wit h sorrow and do not spare you. "As the Father hath loved Me, so also I love you," I said to My disciples, and I certainly did not send them out to temporal joys but rather to gr eat struggles, not to honors but to contempt, not to idleness, but to labors, not to rest but to bring forth much fruit in patience. Do you, My child, remember these words.
