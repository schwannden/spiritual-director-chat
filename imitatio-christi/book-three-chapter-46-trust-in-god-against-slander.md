# BOOK THREE: 

## Chapter 46: Trust In God Against Slander

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
MY CHILD, stand firm and trus t in Me. For what are words but words? They fly through the air but hurt not a stone. If you ar e guilty, consider how  you would gladly amend. If you are not conscious of any fault, think that you wish to bear this for the sake of God. It is little enough for you occasiona lly to endure words, since you are not yet strong enough to bear hard blows. 
And why do such small matters pierce you to the heart, unless because you are still carnal and pay more heed to men than you ought? You do not wish to be reproved for your faults and you seek shelter in excuses because you are afraid of being despised. But look into yourself more thoro ughly and you will learn that  the world is still alive in you, in a vain desire to please men.  For when you shrink from being abased and confounded for your failings, it is plain indeed that you are not truly humble or truly dead to the world, and that the worl d is not crucified in you. 
Listen to My word, and you will not value ten thousand words of  men. Behold, if every malicious thing that could possibly be invented were uttered against you, what harm could it do if you ignor ed it all and gave it no more thought than you would a blade of grass? Could it so much as pluck one hair from your head? 
He who does not keep his heart within hi m, and who does not have God before his eyes is easily moved by a word of dis paragement. He who trusts in Me, on the other hand, and who has no desire to stand by his own judgment, will be free from the fear of men. For I am the judge and disc erner of all secrets. I know  how all things happen. I know who causes injury and who suffers it. From Me that word proceeded, and with My permission it happened, that out of many hearts thoughts ma y be revealed. I shall judge the guilty and the innocent; but I have wished beforehand to try them both by secret judgment. 
The testimony of man is often deceiving,  but My judgment is true -- it will stand and not be overthrown. It is hidden from many  and made known to but a few. Yet it is never mistaken and cannot be mistaken even t hough it does not seem right in the eyes of the unwise. 
To Me, therefore, you ought to come in every decision, not depending on your own judgment. For the just man will not be disturbed, no matter what may befall him

from God. Even if an unjust charge be made against him he will not be much troubled. 
Neither will he exult vainly if through others he is justly acquitted. He considers that it is I Who search the hearts and inmo st thoughts of men, that I do not judge according to the face of things or human appearances. Fo r what the judgment of men considers praiseworthy is often wort hy of blame in My sight. 
 
THE DISCIPLE  
 
O Lord God, just Judge, strong and patient, You Who know the weakness and depravity of men, be my strengt h and all my confidence, for my own conscience is not sufficient for me. You know what I do not know , and, therefore, I ou ght to humble myself whenever I am accused and bear it meekly. Fo rgive me, then, in Your mercy for my every failure in this regard, and give me  once more the grace of greater endurance. 
Better to me is Your abundant mercy in obtaining pardon than t he justice which I imagine in defending the secrets of my cons cience. And though I am not conscious to myself of any fault, yet I cannot thereby justify myself , because without Your mercy no man living will be justif ied in Your sight.
