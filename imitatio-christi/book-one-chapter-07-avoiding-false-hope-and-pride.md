## Chapter 7: Avoiding False Hope And Pride

VAIN is the man who puts his trus t in men, in created things.  
Do not be ashamed to serve others for the love of Jesus Christ and to seem poor in this world. Do not be self-sufficient but pl ace your trust in God. Do what lies in your power and God will aid your good will. Put no tr ust in your own learning nor in the cunning of any man, but rather in the gr ace of God Who helps the humble and humbles the proud. 
If you have wealth, do not glory in it, nor in  friends because they are powerful, but in God Who gives all things and Who desires above all to give Himself. Do not boast of personal stature or of physi cal beauty, qualities which ar e marred and destroyed by a little sickness. Do not take pride in your ta lent or ability, lest you displease God to Whom belongs all the natural  gifts that you have. 
Do not think yourself better than ot hers lest, perhaps, you be accounted worse before God Who knows what is in man. Do not take pride in your good deeds, for God's judgments differ from those of  men and what pleases them often displeases Him. If there is good in you, see more good in others, so that you may remain humble. It does no harm to esteem yourself less than anyone else, but it is very harmful to think yourself better than even one. The humble live in continuous peace, while in the hearts of the proud are envy and frequent anger.
