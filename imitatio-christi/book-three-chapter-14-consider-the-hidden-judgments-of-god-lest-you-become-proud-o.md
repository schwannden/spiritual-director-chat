## Chapter 14: Consider The Hidden Judgments Of God Lest You Become Proud Of Your Own Good Deeds

THE DISCIPLE

YOU thunder forth Your j udgments over me, Lord. Y ou shake all my bones with fear and trembling, and my soul is very much afraid. I stand in awe as  I consider that the heavens are not pure in Your sight. If You found wickedness in the angels and did not

spare them, what will become of  me? Stars have fallen from  heaven, and I -- I who am but dust -- how can I be presumptuous? They  whose deeds seemed worthy of praise have fallen into the depths, and I have s een those who ate the bread of angels delighting themselves wit h the husks of swine.
There is no holiness, then, if You withdr aw Your hand, Lord. There is no wisdom if You cease to guide, no courage if You ceas e to defend. No chastity is secure if You do not guard it. Our vigilance avails nothing if Your holy watchfulness does not protect us. Left to ourselves we sink and perish, but visited by You we are lifted up and live. We are truly unstable, but You ma ke us strong. We grow luke warm, but You inflame us. Oh, how humbly and lowly should I consider myself! How very little should I esteem anything that seems good in me! How profoundly shou ld I submit to Your unfathomable judgments, Lord, where I find myself to be but nothing!
O immeasurable weight! O impassable sea, where I find myself to be nothing but bare nothingness! Where, then, is glory's hiding place? Where can there be any trust in my own virtue? All vainglory is swallowed up in the depths of Your judgments upon me.
What is all flesh in Your sight? Shall t he clay glory against Him that formed it?
How can he whose heart is truly subject to  God be lifted up by vainglory? The whole world will not make him proud whom truth has subjected to itself. Nor shall he who has placed all his hope in God be moved by the t ongues of flatterers. For behold, even they who speak are nothing; they will pass away with the sound of their words, but the truth of the Lord remains forever.
