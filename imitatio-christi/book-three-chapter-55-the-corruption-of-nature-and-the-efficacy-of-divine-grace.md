## Chapter 55: The Corruption Of Nature And The Efficacy Of Divine Grace

THE DISCIPLE  
 
O LORD, my God, Who created me to Your own image and likeness, grant me this grace which You have shown to be so gr eat and necessary for salvation, that I may overcome my very evil nature that is drawi ng me to sin and perdition. For I feel in my flesh the law of sin contradicting the law of  my mind and leading me captive to serve sensuality in many things. I cannot resist the passions thereof unless Your most holy grace warmly infused into my heart assist me. 
There is need of Your grace,  and of great grace, in order to overcome a nature prone to evil from youth. For through the firs t man, Adam, nature is fallen and weakened by sin, and the punishment of that stain has fallen upon all mankind. Thus nature itself, which You created good and right, is consider ed a symbol of vice and the weakness of corrupted nature, because when left to itself it tends toward evil and to baser things. The little strength remaining in it is like a spark hidden in ashes. That strength is natural reason which, surrounded by thick darkness, still has the power  of judging good and evil, of seeing the difference between true and fals e, though it is not able to fulfill all that it approves and does not enjoy the full light  of truth or soundness of affection.

Hence it is, my God, that according to the inward man I delight in Your law, knowing that Your command is good, just, and holy, and that it proves the necessity of shunning all evil and sin. But in the flesh I keep the law of sin, obeying sensuality rather than reason. Hence, also, it is that t he will to good is present in me, but how to accomplish it I know not. Hence, too, I often propose many good things, but because the grace to help my weakness is lacking, I re coil and give up at the slightest resistance. 
Thus it is that I know the way of perfe ction and see clearly enough how I ought to act, but because I am pressed down by the weight  of my own corruption I do not rise to more perfect things. 
How extremely necessary to me, O Lord, Your grace is to  begin any good deed, to carry it on and bring it to  completion! For without grace I can do nothing, but with its strength I can do all things in You. O Grace truly heavenly, without which our merits are nothing and no gifts of nat ure are to be esteemed! 
Before You, O Lord, no arts or riches, no beauty or strength, no wit or intelligence avail without grace. For the gifts of nature are common to good and bad alike, but the peculiar gift of Your elect is grace or lo ve, and those who are signed with it are held worthy of everlasting life. So excellent is th is grace that without it  no gift of prophecy or of miracles, no meditation be it ever so exal ted, can be considered anything. Not even faith or hope or other virtues are acceptable to You without charity and grace. 
O most blessed grace, which makes the poor in spirit rich in virtues, which renders him who is rich in many good things humble of heart, come, descend upon me, fill me quickly with your consolation lest my soul faint with weariness and dryness of mind. 
Let me find grace in Your sight, I beg,  Lord, for Your grace is enough for me, even though I obtain none of the things wh ich nature desires. If I am tempted and afflicted with many tribulations , I will fear no evils while Your grace is with me. This is my strength. This will give me counsel and hel p. This is more powerful than all my enemies and wiser than all the wise. This is the mistress of trut h, the teacher of discipline, the light of the heart, the consol er in anguish, the banisher of sorrow, the expeller of fear, the nourisher  of devotion, the producer of tears. What am I without grace, but dead wood, a useless br anch, fit only to be cast away? 
Let Your grace, therefore, go before me and follow me, O Lor d, and make me always intent upon good works, thr ough Jesus Christ, Your Son.
