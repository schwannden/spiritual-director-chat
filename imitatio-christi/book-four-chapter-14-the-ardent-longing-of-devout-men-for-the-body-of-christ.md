# BOOK FOUR: 

## Chapter 14: The Ardent Longing Of Devout Men For The Body Of Christ

THE DISCIPLE  
 
HOW great is the abundance of Your kindn ess, O Lord, which You have hidden from those who fear You! 
When I think how some devout persons come to Your Sacrament with the greatest devotion and love, I am frequently as hamed and confused that I approach Your altar and the table of Holy Communion so cold ly and indifferently; that I remain so dry and devoid of heartfelt affection;  that I am not completely inflamed in Your presence, O my God, nor so strongly drawn and attracte d as many devout persons who, in their great desire for Communion and intense heart lo ve, could not restrain their tears but longed from the depths of thei r souls and bodies to embrace You, the Fountain of Life. 
These were able to appease and allay their hunger in no other way than by receiving Your Body with all joy and spiritual eagerne ss. The faith of these men was true and ardent -- convincing proof of Your sacred pr esence. They whose hearts burn so ardently within them when Jesus lives wit h them truly know their Lor d in the breaking of bread. 
Such affection and devotion, such mighty love and zeal are often far beyond me. 
Be merciful to me, O sw eet, good, kind Jesus, and grant  me, Your poor suppliant, sometimes at least to feel in Holy Communion a little of the tenderness of Your love, that my faith may grow str onger, that my hope in Your goodness may increase, and that charity, once perfectly kindl ed within me by tasting heavenly manna, may never fail. 
Your mercy can give me the grace I long for and can visit me most graciously with fervor of soul according to Your good pleasure. For although I am not now inflamed with as great desire as those who are singularly devoted to You, yet by Your grace I long for this same great flame, praying and seeking a place among all such ardent lovers that I may be number ed among their holy company.
