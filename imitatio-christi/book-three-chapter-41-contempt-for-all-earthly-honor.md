# BOOK THREE: 

## Chapter 41: Contempt For All Earthly Honor

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
MY CHILD, do not take it to heart if you see others honored and advanced, while you yourself are despised and humbled. Lift up your heart to Me in heaven and the contempt of men on eart h will not grieve you. 
 
THE DISCIPLE  
 
Lord, we are blinded and quickly misled by v anity. If I examine myself rightly, no injury has ever been done me by any creatur e; hence I have nothing for which to make just complaint to You. Bu t I have sinned often and gravely against You; therefore is every creature in arms against me. Confusion and contempt should in justice come upon me, but to You due praise, honor, and glor y. And unless I prepare myself to be willingly despised and forsaken by every creature, to be considered absolutely nothing, I

cannot have interior peace and strength, nor can I be enlight ened spiritually or completely united with You.
