## Chapter 40: Man Has No Good In Himself And Can Glory In Nothing

THE DISCIPLE

LORD, what is man that You are mindful of  him, or the son of man that You visit him? What has man deserved that You should give him Your grace? What cause have I, Lord, to complain if You desert me, or w hat objection can I have if You do not do what I ask? This I may think and say in all truth: "L ord, I am nothing, of  myself I have nothing that is good; I am lacking in all things, and I am ever tending toward nothing. And unless I have Your help and am inwardly strengthened by You, I become quite lukewarm and lax."
But You, Lord, are always the same. You remain forever, always good, just, and holy; doing all things rightly, justly, and holily , disposing them wisely. I, however, who

am more ready to go backward than forward,  do not remain always in one state, for I change with the seasons. Yet my condition qui ckly improves when it pleases You and when You reach forth Your helping hand. For You alone, without human aid, can help me and strengthen me so greatly that my h eart shall no more change but be converted and rest solely in You. Hence,  if I knew well how to cast aside all earthly consolation, either to attain devotion or because of t he necessity which, in the absence of human solace, compels me to seek You alone, then I could deservedly hope for Your grace and rejoice in the gift of new consolation.
Thanks be to You from Whom all things come, whenever it is well with me. In Your sight I am vanity and not hingness, a weak, unstable man.  In what, therefore, can I glory, and how can I wish to be highly regarded? Is it because I am nothing? This, too, is utterly vain. Indeed, the greatest vanity is  the evil plague of empty self-glory, because it draws one away from true glory and robs  one of heavenly grace. For when a man is pleased with himself he displeases You, when he pants after human praise he is deprived of true virtue. But it is  true glory and holy exultation to glory in You and not in self, to rejoice in Your name rather than in  one's own virtue, and not to delight in any creature except for Your sake.
Let Your name, not mine, be praised. Let Your work, no t mine, be magnified. Let Your holy name be blessed, but let no human pr aise be given to me. You are my glory.
You are the joy of my heart. In You I will gl ory and rejoice all the day, and for myself I will glory in nothing but my infirmities.
Let the Jews seek the glory that come s from another. I will seek that which comes from God alone. All human glory, all te mporal honor, all worl dly position is truly vanity and foolishness compared to Your everlasting glory. O my Tr uth, my Mercy, my God, O Blessed Trinity, to You alone be praise and honor, power and glory, throughout all the endless ages of ages.
