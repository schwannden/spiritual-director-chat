## Chapter 16: Bearing With The Faults Of Others

UNTIL God ordains otherwise, a man ought to bear patiently whatever he cannot correct in himself and in others. Consider it better thus -- perhaps to  try your patience and to test you, for without such patience a nd trial your merits are of little account. 
Nevertheless, under such difficulties you shou ld pray that God will consent to help you bear them calmly.

If, after being admonished once or twice, a person does not amend, do not argue with him but commit the whole matter to God that His will and honor may be furthered in all His servants, for God knows well how to turn evil to good. Try to bear patiently with the defects and infirmities of others, what ever they may be, because you also have many a fault which others must endure. 
If you cannot make yourself what you would wish to be, how can you bend others to your will? We want them to be perfect, yet we do not co rrect our own faults. We wish them to be severely corrected, yet we will not correct ourselves. Their great liberty displeases us, yet we would not be denied w hat we ask. We would have them bound by laws, yet we will allow ourselves to be restrained in nothing. Hence, it is clear how seldom we think of others as we do of ourselves. 
If all were perfect, what should we have to  suffer from others for God's sake? But God has so ordained, that we may learn to bear with one another's burdens, for there is no man without fault, no man without burden, no man suffici ent to himself nor wise enough. Hence we must support one another, console one another, mutually help, counsel, and advise, for the m easure of every man's virtue is best revealed in time of adversity -- adversity that does not weak en a man but rather shows what he is.
