## Chapter 38: The Right Ordering Of External Affairs ; Recourse To God In Dangers

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
MY CHILD, you must strive diligently to be inwardly free, to have mastery over yourself everywhere, in every external act and occupation, that all things be subject to you and not you to them, that yo u be the master and director of  your actions, not a slave or a mere hired servant. You should be rather a free man and a true Hebrew, arising to the status and freedom of t he children of God who stand above present things to contemplate those which are eternal; who look upon passing affairs with the left eye and upon those of heaven with the right; whom temporal things do not so attract that they cling to them, but who rather put these things  to such proper service as is ordained and instituted by God, t he great Workmaster, Who leaves no thing unordered in His creation. 
If, likewise, in every happening you ar e not content simply with outward appearances, if you do not regard with carnal eyes things which you see and hear, but whatever be the affair, enter with Moses into the tabernacle to ask advice of the Lord, you will sometimes hear the divine answer and re turn instructed in many things present and to come. For Moses always had recourse to the tabernacle for the solution of doubts and questions, and fled to prayer for support in dangers and the evil deeds of men. So you also should take refuge in the secret chamber of your heart, begging earnestly for divine aid. 
For this reason, as we read, Joshua and the children of Israel were deceived by the Gibeonites because they did not first seek counsel of the Lord, but trusted too much in fair words and hence were deceived by false piety.
