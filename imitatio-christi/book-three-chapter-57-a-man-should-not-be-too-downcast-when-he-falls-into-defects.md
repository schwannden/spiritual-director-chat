# BOOK THREE: 

## Chapter 57: A Man Should Not Be Too Downcast When He Falls Into Defects

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
MY CHILD, patience and humility in adversi ty are more pleasing to Me than much consolation and devoti on when things are going well. 
Why are you saddened by some little thi ng said against you? Even if it had been more you ought not to have been affected. But now le t it pass. It is not the first, nor is it anything new, and if you live long it will not be the last. 
You are manly enough so long as you meet no opposition. You give good advice to others, and you know how to strengt hen them with words, but when unexpected tribulation comes to your door, you fail both in  counsel and in strength. Consider your great weakness, then, which you experience so  often in small matters. Yet when these and like trials happen, they happen for your good. 
Put it out of your heart as best you know  how, and if it has touched you, still do not let it cast you down or confuse you for long.  Bear it patiently at least, if you cannot bear it cheerfully. Even though you bear it unwi llingly, and are indignant  at it, restrain yourself and let no ill-ordered words pass y our lips at which the weak might be scandalized. The storm that is now aroused  will soon be quieted and your inward grief will be sweetened by returning grace. "I yet live," says the Lord, "ready to help you and to console you more and more, if you trust in Me and call devoutly upon Me." 
Remain tranquil and prepare to bear still greater  trials. All is not lost even though you be troubled oftener or tempted more grie vously. You are a man, not God. You are flesh, not an angel. How can you possibly expec t to remain always in the same state of virtue when the angels in heaven and the first m an in paradise failed to do so? I am He Who rescues the afflicted and brings to My divinity those who know their own weakness. 
 
THE DISCIPLE  
 
Blessed be Your words, O Lord, sweet er to my mouth than honey and the honeycomb. What would I do in such great tria ls and anxieties, if You did not strengthen me with Your holy words? If I may but attain to the haven of  salvation, what does it matter what or how much I suffer? Gr ant me a good end. Grant me a happy passage out of this world. Remember me, my God, and lead me by  the right way into Your kingdom.
