## Chapter 3: Listen Humbly To The Words Of God. Many Do Not Heed Them

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, hear My words, words of greatest sweetness surpassing all the knowledge of the philosophers an d wise men of earth. My word s are spirit and life, and they are not to be weighed by man's understanding . They are not to be invoked in vanity but are to be heard in silence, and accept ed with all humility and wit h great affection.

THE DISCIPLE

"Happy is the man whom Thou admonishest, O Lord, and teachest out of Thy law, to give him peace from the days of evil,"31 and that he be not desolate on earth.

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

I taught the prophets from t he beginning, and even to this day I continue to speak to all men. But many are har dened. Many are deaf to My voice. Most men listen more willingly to the world than to God. They are more ready to  follow the appetite of their flesh than the good pleasure of  God. The world, which promises small and passing things, is served with great eagerness: I prom ise great and eternal things and the hearts of men grow dull. Who is there that serves and obeys Me in all things with as great care as that with which the worl d and its masters are served?
"Be thou ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea speaketh."32 And if you ask why, listen to the cause: for a small gain they travel fa r; for eternal life many will scarcely lift a foot from the ground. They seek a petty reward, and sometimes fight shamefully in law courts for a single piece of m oney. They are not afraid to wo rk day and night for a trifle or an empty promise. But, for an unchanging good, for a re ward beyond estimate, for the greatest honor and for glory everlasting, it  must be said to their shame that men begrudge even the least fatigue. Be ashamed, t hen, lazy and complaining servant, that they should be found more eager for perdition than you are for life, that they rejoice more in vanity than you in truth.
Sometimes indeed their expectations fail t hem, but My promise never deceives, nor does it send away empty-handed him who tr usts in Me. What I have promised I will give. What I have said I will fulfill, if only a ma n remain faithful in My love to the end. I am the rewarder of all t he good, the strong approver of all who are devoted to Me.
Write My words in your heart and meditate  on them earnestly, for in time of temptation they will be very necessary. What you do not underst and when you read, you will learn in the day of visitation. I am wont to visit My elec t in two ways -- by temptation and by consolation. To them I re ad two lessons daily -- one reproving their vices, the other exhorting t hem to progress in virtue. He who has My words and despises them has that which s hall condemn him on the last day.

A PRAYER FOR THE GRACE OF DEVOTION

O Lord my God, You are all my good. And who am I that I should dare to speak to You? I am Your poorest and meanest servan t, a vile worm, much more poor and contemptible than I know or dare to say. Yet remember me, Lord, because I am nothing, I have nothing, and I can do nothing. You alo ne are good, just, and holy. You can do all things, You give all things, You fill all things: only the sinner do You leave empty-handed. Remember Your tender mercies and fill my heart with Your  grace, You Who will not allow Your works to be in vain. How can I bear this life of misery unless You comfort me with Your mercy and grace? Do not turn Your fa ce from me. Do not delay Your visitation. Do not withdraw Your consolation, lest in Your sight my soul become as desert land. Teach me, Lord, to  do Your will. Teach me to  live worthily and humbly in Your sight, for You are my wisdom Who know  me truly, and Who knew me even before the world was made and befor e I was born into it.

32Isa. 23:4.
