# BOOK THREE: 

## Chapter 11: The Longings Of Our Hearts Must Be Examined And Moderated

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
MY CHILD, it is necessary for you to l earn many things which you have not yet learned well. 
 
THE DISCIPLE  
 
What are they, Lord? 
 
THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
That you conform your desires entirely according to My good pleasure, and be not a lover of self but an ear nest doer of My will. Desire s very often inflame you and drive you madly on, but consider whether  you act for My honor, or for your own advantage. If I am the cause, you will be well content with whatever I ordain. If, on the other hand, any self-seeking lurk in you, it  troubles you and we ighs you down. Take care, then, that you do not rely too much on preconceived desire that has no reference to Me, lest you repent later on and be disp leased with what at first pleased you and which you desired as being for the best. Not every desire which seems good should be followed immediately, nor, on the other hand, should every contrary affection be at once rejected. 
It is sometimes well to use a little restra int even in good desires and inclinations, lest through too much eagerness you bring upon yourself distraction of mind; lest through your lack of discipline you create sc andal for others; or lest you be suddenly upset and fall because of resistance from ot hers. Sometimes, however, you must use violence and resist your sensual appetite bravel y. You must pay no attention to what the flesh does or does not desire, taking pains that  it be subjected, even by force, to the spirit. And it should be chastised and forced to  remain in subjection until it is prepared for anything and is taught to be satisfied with li ttle, to take pleasure in simple things, and not to murmur against inconveniences.
