## Chapter 51: When We Cannot Attain To The Highest , We Must Practice The Humble

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, you cannot always continue in t he more fervent desire of virtue, or remain in the higher stage of contemplation, but because of humanity's sin you must sometimes descend to lower things and bear t he burden of this corruptible life, albeit unwillingly and wearily. As long as you wear a mortal body you will suffer weariness and heaviness of heart. You ought, therefore, to bew ail in the flesh the burden of the flesh which keeps you from giving yourself unceas ingly to spiritual exercises and divine contemplation.
In such condition, it is well for you to  apply yourself to humble, outward works and to refresh yourself in good deeds, to  await with unshaken confidence My heavenly visitation, patiently to bear your exile and dr yness of mind until you are again visited by Me and freed of all anxieties. For I will caus e you to forget your labors and to enjoy inward quiet. I will spread before you the open fiel ds of the Scriptures, so that with an

open heart you may begin to advance in the way of My commandments. And you will say: the sufferings of this time are not wo rthy to be compared with the future glory which shall be revealed to us.
