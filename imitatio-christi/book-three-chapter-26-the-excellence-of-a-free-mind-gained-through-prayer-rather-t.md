## Chapter 26: The Excellence Of A Free Mind, Gained Through Prayer Rather Than By Study

THE DISCIPLE  
 
IT IS the mark of a perfect man, Lord, nev er to let his mind relax in attention to heavenly things, and to pass through many cares as though he had none; not as an indolent man does, but having by the certai n prerogative of a fr ee mind no disorderly affection for any created being. 
Keep me, I beg You, most merciful God, from  the cares of this life, lest I be too much entangled in them. Keep me from m any necessities of the body, lest I be ensnared by pleasure. Keep me from all dark ness of mind, lest I be broken by troubles and overcome. I do not ask deliv erance from those things wh ich worldly vanity desires so eagerly, but from those miseries which, by the common curse of humankind, oppress the soul of Your servant in  punishment and keep him from ent ering into the liberty of spirit as often as he would.

My God, Sweetness beyond words, make bi tter all the carnal comfort that draws me from love of the eternal and lures me to its evil self by the sight of some delightful good in the present. Let it not overcome me , my God. Let not fl esh and blood conquer me. Let not the world and its brief glory dec eive me, nor the devil trip me by his craftiness. Give me courage to  resist, patience to endure, and constancy to persevere. 
Give me the soothing unction of Your spirit ra ther than all the consol ations of the world, and in place of carnal love, infuse into me the love of Your name. 
Behold, eating, drinking, clothing, and other necessities that sustain the body are burdensome to the fervent soul. Grant me the grace to use such comforts temperately and not to become entangled in too great a desire for them. It is  not lawful to cast them aside completely, for nature must be sustained, but Your holy law forbids us to demand superfluous things and things that are simply for pleasure, else the flesh would rebel against the spirit. In these matters, I beg, let Your hand guide and direct me, so that I may not overstep the law in any way.
