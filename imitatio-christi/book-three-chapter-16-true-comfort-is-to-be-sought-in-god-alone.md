## Chapter 16: True Comfort Is To Be Sought In God Alone

THE DISCIPLE

WHATEVER I can desire or imagine for my own comfort I look for not here but hereafter. For if I alone should have all t he world's comforts and could enjoy all its delights, it is certain that they could not  long endure. Therefore,  my soul, you cannot enjoy full consolation or perfect  delight except in  God, the Consoler of the poor and the Helper of the humble. Wait a little, my soul , wait for the divine promise and you will have an abundance of all good things in heaven. If you desire these present things too much, you will lose those which are everlasting and heavenly. Use temporal things but desire eternal things. You cannot be satisfied with any temporal goods because you were not created to enjoy them.
Even if you possessed all created things you could not be happy and blessed; for in God, Who created all these things, your whole blessedness and happiness consists -- not indeed such happiness as is seen and praised by lovers of the world, but such as that for which the good and faithful servants of Christ wait, and of which the spiritual and pure of heart, whose conversation is in heaven, sometime have a foretaste.
Vain and brief is all human consolation. But that which is received inwardly from the Truth is blessed and true.  The devout man carries his Consoler, Jesus, everywhere with him, and he says to Him: "Be with me, Lord Jesus, in every place and at all times.
Let this be my consolation, to be willing to forego all hum an comforting. And if Your consolation be wanting to me, le t Your will and just trial of  me be my greatest comfort.
For You will not always be angry, nor will You threaten forever."
