## Chapter 16: We Should Show Our Needs To Christ And Ask His Grace

THE DISCIPLE

O MOST kind, most loving Lord, Whom I now desire to receive with devotion, You know the weakness and the necessity which I suffer, in what great evils and vices I am involved, how often I am depress ed, tempted, defiled, and troubled.
To You I come for help, to You I pray for comfort and relief. I speak to Him Who knows all things, to Whom my whole inner life is manifest, and Who alone can perfectly comfort and help me.
You know what good things I am most in  need of and how poor I am in virtue.
Behold I stand before You, poor and naked, asking Your grace and imploring Your mercy.
Feed Your hungry beggar. Inflame my col dness with the fire of Your love.
Enlighten my blindness wit h the brightness of Your presence.  Turn all earthly things to bitterness for me, all grievance and adversity to patience, all lowly creation to contempt and oblivion. Raise my heart to You in heav en and suffer me not to wander on earth.
From this moment to all eter nity do You alone grow sweet to me, for You alone are my food and drink, my love and my joy,  my sweetness and my total good.

Let Your presence wholly inflame me, c onsume and transform me into Yourself, that I may become one spirit with You by the grace of inwa rd union and by the melting power of Your ardent love.
Suffer me not to go from You fasting and th irsty, but deal with me mercifully as You have so often and so wonderfully dealt with Your saints.
What wonder if I were completely inflamed by You to die to myself, since You are the fire ever burning and never dying, a love purifying the hear t and enlightening the understanding.
