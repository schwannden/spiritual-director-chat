## Chapter 17: The Burning Love And Strong Desire To Receive Christ

THE DISCIPLE

WITH greatest devotion and ardent love, wit h all affection and fervor of heart I wish to receive You, O Lord, as many sain ts and devout persons, most pleasing to You in their holiness of life and most fervent in devotion, desired You in Holy Communion.
O my God, everlasting love, my fi nal good, my happiness unending, I long to receive You with as strong a des ire and as worthy a reverence as any of the saints ever had or could have felt, and though I am not wort hy to have all these sentiments of devotion, still I offer You the full affection of my heart as if I alone had all those most pleasing and ardent desires.
Yet, whatever a God-fearing mind can conceive and desire, I offer in its entirety to You with the greatest reverence and inward affection. I wish to keep nothing for self but to offer to You, willingly and most freely, myself and a ll that is mine.
O Lord God, my Creator and my Redeemer, I long to receive You this day with such reverence, praise, and honor, with such  gratitude, worthiness and love, with such faith, hope, and purity as that with which Your most holy Mo ther, the glorious Virgin Mary, longed for and received You when she humbly and devoutly answered the angel who announced to her the mystery of the Incarnation: "Behold  the handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me a ccording to thy word."
52 Likewise as Your blessed precursor, the most excellent of saints, John the Baptist, gladdened by Your presenc e, exulted in the Holy Ghost while yet enclosed in the womb of his mother, and afterward seeing Jesus walking among men, humbled himself and with devout love declared: "T he friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy bec ause of the bridegroom's voice,"53 even so I long to be inflamed with great and holy desires and to give myself to You with all my heart.
Therefore I offer and present to You the gladness of all devout hearts, their ardent affection, their ment al raptures, their supernatur al illuminations and heavenly visions together with all the virtues and pr aises which have been or  shall be celebrated

53John 3:29.

by all creatures in heaven and on earth, for myself and all commended to my prayers, that You may be worthily praised and glorified forever.
Accept, O Lord my God, my promises and des ires of giving You infinite praise and boundless benediction, which in the vastness of Your ineffable greatness are justly due You. This I render and desire to render ev ery day and every moment of time, and in my loving prayers I invite and entreat all celestia l spirits and all the faithful to join me in giving You praise and thanks.
Let all people, races, and tongues praise You and with the greatest joy and most ardent devotion magnify Your sweet and holy name. And let all who reverently and devoutly celebrate this most great Sacrament and receive it in the fullness of faith, find kindness and mercy in You and humbly pray for me, a sinner. And when they have received the longed-for devotion and blissful  union, and, well consoled and wonderfully refreshed, have retired from Your holy, Y our celestial table, may they deign to remember my poor soul.
