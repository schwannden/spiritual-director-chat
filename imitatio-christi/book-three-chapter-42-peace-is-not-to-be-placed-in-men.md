## Chapter 42: Peace Is Not To Be Placed In Men

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, if you place your peace in any  creature because of your own feeling or for the sake of his company, you will be unsettled and entangled. But if you have recourse to the ever-living and abiding Truth, you will not grieve if a friend should die or forsake you. Your love for your friend s hould be grounded in Me, and for My sake you should love whoever seems to be good and is ve ry dear to you in this life. Without Me friendship has no strength and cannot endure. Love which I do not bind is neither true nor pure.
You ought, therefore, to be so dead to such human affections as to wish as far as lies within you to be without the fellowshi p of men. Man draw s nearer to God in proportion as he withdraws farther from all ear thly comfort. And he ascends higher to God as he descends lower into himself and gr ows more vile in his own eyes. He who attributes any good to himself hinders God' s grace from coming in to his heart, for the grace of the Holy Spirit seeks always the humble heart.
If you knew how to annihilate yourself completely and empty yourself of all created love, then I should overflow in y ou with great grace. When you look to creatures, the sight of the Creator is taken from you. Learn, therefore, to conquer yourself in all things for the sake of your Maker. Then will you be able to attain to divine knowledge. But anything, no matter how sma ll, that is loved and regarded inordinately keeps you back from the highest good and corrupts the soul.
