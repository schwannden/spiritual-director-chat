# BOOK THREE: 

## Chapter 43: Beware Vain And Worldly Knowledge

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
MY CHILD, do not let the fine-sounding an d subtle words of men deceive you. 
For the kingdom of heaven consists not in talk but in virtue. Attend, rather, to My words which enkindle the heart and enlighten the mind, which exci te contrition and abound in manifold consolations. Never read them for the purpose of appearing more learned or more wise. Apply yourself to mortifying your vices, for this will benefit you more than your understanding of many difficult questions. 
Though you shall have read and learned many things, it will always be necessary for you to return to this one principle: I am He who teaches man knowledge, and to the little ones I give a clearer understanding than can be taught by man. He to whom I

speak will soon be wise and his soul will profi t. But woe to those who inquire of men about many curious things, and care very little about the way they serve Me. 
The time will come when Christ, the Teacher  of teachers, the Lord of angels, will appear to hear the lessons of all -- that is, to  examine the conscien ce of everyone. Then He will search Jerusalem with lamps and the hidden things of darkness will be brought to light and the arguings of men's tongues be silenced. 
I am He Who in one moment so enlightens  the humble mind that it comprehends more of eternal truth than could be learned by  ten years in the schools. I teach without noise of words or clash of opinions, wit hout ambition for honor or confusion of argument. 
I am He Who teaches man to despise earthly possessions and to loathe present things, to ask after the eternal, to hunger  for heaven, to fly honors and to bear with scandals, to place all hope in Me, to desir e nothing apart from Me, and to love Me ardently above all things. For a certain man by loving Me in timately learned divine truths and spoke wonders. He profited more by leav ing all things than by studying subtle questions. 
To some I speak of common things, to others of special matters. To some I appear with sweetness in signs and figures, and to others I appear in great light and reveal mysteries. The voice of books is but a single voice, yet it does not teach all men alike, because I within them am the Teacher and the Truth, the Exam iner of hearts, the Understander of thoughts, t he Promoter of acts, distri buting to each as I see fit.
