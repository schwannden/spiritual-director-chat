## Chapter 24: Judgment And The Punishment Of Sin

IN ALL things consider the end; how you shall stand before the strict Judge from Whom nothing is hidden and Who will pronounce judgment in all justice, accepting neither bribes nor excuses. And you, mise rable and wretched sinner, who fear even the countenance of an angry man, what answer will you make to the God Who knows all your sins? Why do you not provide for y ourself against the day of judgment when no man can be excused or defended by another because each will have enough to do to answer for himself? In this life your work is profitable, your tears acceptable, your sighs audible, your sorrow satisfying and purifying.
The patient man goes through a great and salutary purgatory when he grieves more over the malice of one who harms him than for his own injury; when he prays readily for his enemies and forgives offenses  from his heart; when he does not hesitate to ask pardon of others; when he is more eas ily moved to pity than to anger; when he does frequent violence to himself and tries to br ing the body into complete subjection to the spirit.
It is better to atone for sin now and to cut away vices than to keep them for purgation in the hereafter. In truth, we decei ve ourselves by our ill-advised love of the flesh. What will that fire feed upon but our sins? The more we spare ourselves now and the more we satisfy the flesh, the harder will the reckoning be and the more we keep for the burning.
For a man will be more grievously punished in the things in which he has sinned.
There the lazy will be driven with burni ng prongs, and gluttons tormented with

unspeakable hunger and thirst; the wanton and lust-loving will be bathed in burning pitch and foul brimstone; the envious will howl in their grief like mad dogs.
Every vice will have its own proper puni shment. The proud will be faced with every confusion and the avaric ious pinched with the most ab ject want. One hour of suffering there will be more bitter than a hundred years of the most severe penance here. In this life men sometime s rest from work and enjoy t he comfort of friends, but the damned have no rest or consolation.
You must, therefore, take care and repent of  your sins now so that on the day of judgment you may rest secure with the ble ssed. For on that day the just will stand firm against those who tortured and oppressed t hem, and he who now submits humbly to the judgment of men will arise to pass judgment upon them. The poor and humble will have great confidence, while the proud will be  struck with fear. He who learned to be a fool in this world and to be scorned for Christ will then appear to have been wise.
In that day every trial borne in patience will be pleasing and the voice of iniquity will be stilled; the devout will be glad; the irreligious will m ourn; and the mortified body will rejoice far more than if it had been pam pered with every pleasure. Then the cheap garment will shine with splendor and the rich one become faded and worn; the poor cottage will be more praised than the gilded palac e. In that day persevering patience will count more than all the power in this world; simple obedience will be exalted above all worldly cleverness; a good and clean conscienc e will gladden the heart of man far more than the philosophy of the lear ned; and contempt for riches will be of more weight than every treasure on earth.
Then you will find more consolation in having prayed devoutly than in having fared daintily; you will be happy that you preferred silence to prolonged gossip.
Then holy works will be of greater value than many fair words;  strictness of life and hard penances will be more pleasi ng than all earthly delights.
Learn, then, to suffer little things now t hat you may not have to suffer greater ones in eternity. Prove here w hat you can bear hereafter. If you can suffer only a little now, how will you be able to endure eternal torment? If a little suffering makes you impatient now, what will hell fire do? In tr uth, you cannot have two joys: you cannot taste the pleasures of this worl d and afterward reign with Christ.
If your life to this moment had been full of honors and pleasures, what good would it do if at this instant you should die? All is vanity, therefore, except to love God and to serve Him alone.
He who loves God with all his heart does not fear death or punishment or judgment or hell, because perfect love assures access to God.
It is no wonder that he who still deli ghts in sin fears death and judgment.
It is good, however, that even if love does not as yet restrain you from evil, at least the fear of hell does. The man who cast s aside the fear of God cannot continue long in goodness but will quickly fa ll into the snares of the devil.
