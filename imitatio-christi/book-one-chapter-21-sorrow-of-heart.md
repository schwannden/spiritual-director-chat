## Chapter 21: Sorrow Of Heart

IF YOU wish to make progress in virtue, live in the fear of the Lord, do not look for too much freedom, discip line your senses, and shun inane silliness. Sorrow opens the door to many a blessing whic h dissoluteness usually destroys. 
It is a wonder that any man who considers and meditates on his exiled state and the many dangers to his soul, can ever be per fectly happy in this life. Lighthearted and heedless of our defects, we do not feel the real sorrows of our souls, but often indulge in empty laughter when we have good reason to weep. No liberty is true and no joy is genuine unless it is founded in the fear  of the Lord and a good conscience. 
Happy is the man who can throw off t he weight of every care and recollect himself in holy contrition. Happy is the man who casts from him all that can stain or burden his conscience.

Fight like a man. Habit is overcome by  habit. If you leave men alone, they will leave you alone to do what you have to do. Do not busy yourself about the affairs of others and do not become entangled in the business of your superiors. Keep an eye primarily on yourself and admonish yourself instead of your friends. 
If you do not enjoy the favor of men, do not  let it sadden you; but consider it a serious matter if you do not conduct yourself as well or as carefully as is becoming for a servant of God and a devout religious. 
It is often better and safer for us to have fe w consolations in this life, especially comforts of the body. Yet if we do not have divi ne consolation or experience it rarely, it is our own fault because we seek no sorrow of heart and do not forsake vain outward satisfaction. 
Consider yourself unworthy of divine solace and deserving rather of much tribulation. When a man is perfectly contrite , the whole world is bitter and wearisome to him. 
A good man always finds enough over whic h to mourn and weep; whether he thinks of himself or of his neighbor he know s that no one lives here without suffering, and the closer he examines himself the more he grieves. 
The sins and vices in which we are so entangled that we can rarely apply ourselves to the contemplation of heaven are ma tters for just sorrow and inner remorse. 
I do not doubt that you would correct yourself more earnestly if you would think more of an early death than of a long life. An d if you pondered in your heart the future pains of hell or of purgatory, I believe y ou would willingly endure labor and trouble and would fear no hardship. But since these thoughts never pier ce the heart and since we are enamored of flattering pleasure, we remain  very cold and indifferent. Our wretched body complains so easily because our soul is altogether too lifeless. 
Pray humbly to the Lord, ther efore, that He may give yo u the spirit of contrition and say with the Prophet: "Feed me, Lord, with the bread of mourning and give me to drink of tears in full measure."5
