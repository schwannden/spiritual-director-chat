## Chapter 52: A Man Ought Not To Consider Himself Worthy Of Consolation , But Rather Deserving Of Chastisement

THE DISCIPLE

LORD, I am not worthy of Your consol ation or of any spiritual visitation.
Therefore, You treat me justly when You leave me poor and desolate. For though I could shed a sea of tears, yet I should not be  worthy of Your consolation. Hence, I deserve only to be scourged and punished because I have offended You often and grievously, and have sinned greatly in many thi ngs. In all justice, therefore, I am not worthy of any consolation.
But You, O gracious and merciful God,  Who do not will that Your works should perish, deign to console Your servant bey ond all his merit and above human measure, to show the riches of Your goodness toward the vessels of mercy. For Your consolations are not like the words of men.
What have I done, Lord, that You should confer on me any heavenly comfort? I remember that I have done not hing good, but that I have always been prone to sin and slow to amend. That is true. I cannot deny i t. If I said otherwise You would stand against me, and there would be no one to defend me. What  have I deserved fo r my sins except hell and everlasting fire?
In truth, I confess that I am deserving of all scorn and contempt. Neither is it fitting that I should be remembered among Your  devoted servants. And although it is hard for me to hear this, yet fo r truth's sake I will allege my sins against myself, so that I may more easily deserve to beg Your mercy. W hat shall I say, guilty as I am and full of all confusion? My tongue can say nothing but this alone: "I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned; have mercy on me and pardon me. Suffer me a little that I may pour out my grief, before I go to that dark land that is covered with the shadow of death."
What do you especially demand of a guilty and wretched sinner, except that he be contrite and humble himself for his sins? In true sorrow and humility of heart hope of forgiveness is born, the troubled conscience is reconciled, grace is found, man is preserved from the wrath to come, and G od and the penitent meet with a holy kiss.
To You, O Lord, humble sorrow for sins is  an acceptable sacrific e, a sacrifice far sweeter than the perfume of incense. This is also the pleasing ointment which You would have poured upon Your sacred feet, for a contrite and humble heart You have never despised. Here is a place of refuge from the force of t he enemy's anger. Here is amended and washed away what ever defilement has been contracted elsewhere.
