## Chapter 23: Four Things Which Bring Great Peace

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, I will teach you now the way of peace and true liberty.
Seek, child, to do the will of others rather than your own.
Always choose to have less rather than more.
Look always for the last place and seek to be beneath all others.
Always wish and pray that the will of God be fully carried out in you.
Behold, such will enter into  the realm of peace and rest.

THE DISCIPLE

O Lord, this brief discourse of Yours contai ns much perfection. It is short in words but full of meaning and abounding in fruit. Certainly if I c ould only keep it faithfully, I should not be so easily disturbed. For as oft en as I find myself tr oubled and dejected, I find that I have departed from this teaching. But You Who can do all things, and Who always love what is for my soul's welfare,  give me increase of grace that I may keep Your words and accomplish my salvation.

A PRAYER AGAINST BAD THOUGHTS

O Lord my God, be not far from me. O my God, hast en to help me, for varied thoughts and great fears have risen up within me , afflicting my soul. How shall I escape them unharmed? How shall I dispel them?
"I will go before you," says the Lord, " and will humble the great ones of earth. I will open the doors of the prison, and wi ll reveal to you hidden secrets."
Do as You say, Lord, and let all evil thought s fly from Your face. This is my hope and my only comfort -- to  fly to You in all tribulation, to confide in You, and to call on You from the depths of my heart and to aw ait patiently for Your consolation.

A PRAYER FOR ENLIGHTENING THE MIND

Enlighten me, good Jesus, with the brightness of internal light, and take away all darkness from the habitation of my hear t. Restrain my wandering thoughts and suppress the temptations which attack me so violently. Fight strongly for me, and vanquish these evil beasts -- t he alluring desires of the fles h -- so that peace may come through Your power and the fullness of Your praise resound in the holy courts, which is a pure conscience. Command the winds and the tempests; say to the sea: "Be still," and to the north wind, "Do not blow ," and there will be a great calm.
Send forth Your light and Your truth to shine on the earth, for I am as earth, empty and formless until You illumine me. Pour  out Your grace from above. Shower my heart with heavenly dew. Open the springs of dev otion to water the earth, that it may produce the best of good fruits. Lift up my hear t pressed down by the weight of sins, and direct all my desires to heavenly thi ngs, that having tasted the sweetness of supernal happiness, I may find no pleasure in thinking of earthly things.
Snatch me up and deliver me from all t he passing comfort of creatures, for no created thing can fully quiet and satisfy my  desires. Join me to Yourself in an inseparable bond of love; because You alo ne can satisfy him who loves You, and without You all things  are worthless.
