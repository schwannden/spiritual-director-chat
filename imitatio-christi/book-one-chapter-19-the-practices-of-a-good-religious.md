## Chapter 19: The Practices Of A Good Religious

THE life of a good religious ought to abound in every virtue so that he is interiorly what to others he appears to be. With good reason there ought to be much more within than appears on the outside, for He who sees within is God, Whom we ought to

reverence most highly wherever we are and in Whose sight we ought to walk pure as the angels. 
Each day we ought to renew our resoluti ons and arouse ourselves to fervor as though it were the first day of our religious life. We ought to  say: "Help me, O Lord God, in my good resolution and in Your holy service.  Grant me now, this very day, to begin perfectly, for thus fa r I have done nothing." 
As our intention is, so will be our progr ess; and he who desires perfection must be very diligent. If the str ong-willed man fails frequently, what  of the man who makes up his mind seldom or half-heartedly? Many are the ways of failing in our resolutions; even a slight omission of religious prac tice entails a loss of some kind. 
Just men depend on the grace of God rather than on their own wisdom in keeping their resolutions. In Him they c onfide every undertaking, for man, indeed, proposes but God disposes, and God's way is not man's. If a habitual exercise is sometimes omitted out of piety or in the interests of anot her, it can easily be resumed later. But if it be abandoned carelessly, thr ough weariness or neglec t, then the fault is great and will prove hurtful. Much as we try, we still fail too easily in many things. Yet we must always have some fixed purpose, especially against things which beset us the most. Our outward and inward lives alike must be closely watched and well ordered, for both are important to perfection. 
If you cannot recollect yourself continuously, do so once a day at least, in the morning or in the evening. In  the morning make a resolu tion and in the evening examine yourself on what you have said this day, what you have done and thought, for in these things perhaps you have often offended God and those about you. 
Arm yourself like a man against the devil 's assaults. Curb your appetite and you will more easily curb every inclination of t he flesh. Never be completely unoccupied, but read or write or pray or meditate or do something for the common good. Bodily discipline, however, must be undertaken with  discretion and is not to be practiced indiscriminately by everyone. 
Devotions not common to all are not to be displayed in public, for such personal things are better performed in private. Furthermore, beware of indifference to community prayer through love of your own devotions. If, however, after doing completely and faithfully all you ar e bound and commanded to do, you then have leisure, use it as personal piety suggests. 
Not everyone can have the same devotion. One exactly suits this person, another that. Different exercises,  likewise, are suitable for diffe rent times, some for feast days and some again for weekdays.  In time of te mptation we need certain devotions. 
For days of rest and peace we need others. So me are suitable when we are sad, others when we are joyful in the Lord. 
About the time of the pr incipal feasts good devotions ought to be renewed and the intercession of the saints more fervently  implored. From one feast day to the next we ought to fix our purpose as though we were  then to pass from this world and come to the eternal holyday. 
During holy seasons, finally, we ought to  prepare ourselves carefully, to live holier lives, and to observe each rule more st rictly, as though we were soon to receive from God the reward of our labors. If this end be def erred, let us believe  that we are not

well prepared and that we are not yet worthy of the great glory that shall in due time be revealed to us. Let us try, meanwhile, to prepare ourselves better for death. 
"Blessed is the servant," says Christ, "whom his master, when he cometh, shall find watching. Amen I say to you: he s hall make him ruler over all his goods."4
