## Chapter 2: God'S Great Goodness And Love Is Shown To Man In This Sacrament

THE DISCIPLE

TRUSTING in Your goodness and great mer cy, O Lord, I come as one sick to the Healer, as one hungry and thirsty to the Fountain of life, as one in need to the King of heaven, a servant to his Lord, a creature to his Creator, a soul in desolation to my gentle Comforter.
But whence is this to me, that You s hould come to me? W ho am I that You should offer Yourself to me? How dares t he sinner to appear in Your presence, and You, how do You condescend to come to the sinner? You know Your servant, and You know that he has nothing good in him that You should grant him this.
I confess, therefore, my unworthiness.  I acknowledge Your goodness. I praise Your mercy, and give thanks for Your immense love. For it is because of Yourself that You do it, not for any merit of mine; so t hat Your goodness may be better known to me, that greater love may be aroused and more perfe ct humility born in me . Since, then, this pleases You and You have so willed it, Your gr aciousness pleases me also. Oh, that my sinfulness may not stand in the way!
O most sweet and merciful Jesus, what  great reverence, thanks, and never- ending praise are due to You for our taking of Your sacred body, wh ose dignity no man can express!
But on what shall I think in this Communi on, this approach to my Lord, Whom I can never reverence as I ought, and yet W hom I desire devoutly to receive? What thought better, more helpful to me than to hu mble myself entirely in Your presence and exalt Your infinite goodness above myself?
I praise You, my God, and extol You forever! I despise  myself and cast myself before You in the depths of my unworthiness. Behold, You are the Holy of holies, and I the scum of sinners! Behold, You bow down to me  who am not worthy to look up to You!
Behold, You come to me! You will to be with me! You invite me to Your banquet! You desire to give me heavenly food, the Bread of Angels to eat, none other than Yourself, the living Bread Who are come down from  heaven and give life to the world.
Behold, whence love proceeds! What conde scension shines forth! What great thanks and praise are due You for these gifts!  Oh, how salutary and profitable was Your design in this institution! How sweet and pleasant the banquet when You gave Yourself as food!
How admirable is Your work, O Lord! How gr eat Your power! How infallible Your truth! For You spoke and all things were made, and this, which You commanded, was done. It is a wonderful thing, worthy of fa ith, overpowering hum an understanding, that You, O Lord, my God, true God and man, are contained whole and entire under the appearance of a little bread and wine, and wit hout being consumed are eaten by him who receives You!
You, the Lord of the univers e, Who have need of nothing,  have willed to dwell in us by means of Your Sacrament. Keep my heart and body clean, so that with a joyous and spotless conscience I may be able often to  celebrate Your Mysteries and to receive

for my eternal salvation what You have ordained and instituted fo r Your special honor and as an everlasting memorial.
Rejoice, my soul, and give thanks to G od for having left you so noble a gift and so special a consolation in this valley of t ears. As often as you renew this Mystery and receive the Body of Christ, so often do y ou enact the work of redemption and become a sharer in all the merits of Christ, for the love of Christ never grows less and the wealth of His mercy is never exhausted.
Therefore, you should prepare yourself for it by constantly renewing your heart and pondering deeply the great mystery of salvat ion. As often as you celebrate or hear Mass, it should seem as great, as new, as sweet  to you as if on that very day Christ became man in the womb of the Virgin, or, hanging on the Cross, suffered and died for the salvation of man.
