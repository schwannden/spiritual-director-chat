# BOOK FOUR: 

## Chapter 5: The Dignity Of The Sacrament And Of The Priesthood

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
HAD you the purity of an angel  and the sanctity of St. John the Baptist, you would not be worthy to receive or administe r this Sacrament. It is not because of any human meriting that a man consecrates and adm inisters the Sacrament of Christ, and receives the Bread of Angels fo r his food. Great is the Myst ery and great t he dignity of priests to whom is given that which has not been granted the angels. For priests alone,

rightly ordained in the Church, have power to  celebrate Mass and consecrate the Body of Christ. 
The priest, indeed, is the mi nister of God, using the wo rd of God according to His command and appointment. God, mo reover, is there -- the chief Author and invisible Worker to Whom all is subject as He wills , to Whom all are obedient as He commands. 
In this most excellent Sacrament, theref ore, you ought to believe in God rather than in your own senses or in any visibl e sign, and thus, with fear and reverence draw near to such a work as this. Look to yourself and see whose ministry has been given you through the imposition of the bishop's hands. 
Behold, you have been made a priest, consec rated to celebrate Mass! See to it now that you offer sacrifice to God faithfu lly and devoutly at proper times, and that you conduct yourself blamelessly. You have not  made your burden light er. Instead, you are now bound by stricter discipline and held to more perfect sanctity. 
A priest ought to be adorned with all virt ues and show the example of a good life to others. His way lies not among the vu lgar and common habits of men but with the angels in heaven and the perfect men on earth. A priest clad in the sacred vestments acts in Christ's place, that he may pray to God both for himself and for all people in a suppliant and humble manner. He has befor e and behind him the sign of the Lord's cross that he may always remember the Passion of Christ. It is before him, on the chasuble, that he may look closely upon the f ootsteps of Christ and try to follow them fervently. It is behind him -- he is signed with it  -- that he may gl adly suffer for God any adversities inflicted by others. 
He wears the cross before him that he ma y mourn his own sins , behind him, that in pity he may mourn the sins of others, and know that he is appointed to stand between God and the sinner, never to become weary of prayer and the holy offering until it is granted him to obtain grace and mercy. 
When the priest celebrates Mass, he honors God, gladdens the angels, strengthens the Church, helps the living, br ings rest to the departed, and wins for himself a share in all good things.
