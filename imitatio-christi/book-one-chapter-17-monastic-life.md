# BOOK ONE:

## Chapter 17: Monastic Life

IF YOU wish peace and concord with others, you must learn to break your will in many things. To live in monasteries or re ligious communities, to remain there without complaint, and to persevere faithfully till deat h is no small matter. Blessed indeed is he who there lives a good life and ther e ends his days in happiness.
If you would persevere in seeking perfection, you must consider yourself a pilgrim, an exile on earth. If you would become a religious, y ou must be content to seem a fool for the sake of Chri st. Habit and tonsure change a man but little; it is the change of life, the complete mortification of passions that endow a true religious.
He who seeks anything but G od alone and the salv ation of his soul will find only trouble and grief, and he who does not try to become the least, the servant of all, cannot remain at peace for long.
You have come to serve, not to rule. You must understand, too, that you have been called to suffer and to work, not to id le and gossip away your time. Here men are tried as gold in a furnace. Here no man c an remain unless he desires with all his heart to humble himself before God.
