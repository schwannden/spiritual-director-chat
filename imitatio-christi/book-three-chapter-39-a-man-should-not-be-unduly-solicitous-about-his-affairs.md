## Chapter 39: A Man Should Not Be Unduly Solicitous About His Affairs

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, always commit your cause to Me . I will dispose of it rightly in good time. Await My ordering of it and it will be to your advantage.

THE DISCIPLE

Lord, I willingly commit all things to You, fo r my anxiety can profit me little. But I would that I were not so concerned about the future, and instead of fered myself without hesitation to Your good pleasure.

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

My child, it often happens t hat a man seeks ardently after something he desires and then when he has attained it he begins to think that it is not at  all desirable; for affections do not remain fixed on the same thi ng, but rather flit fr om one to another. It is no very small matter, therefore,  for a man to forsake himself even in things that are very small.
A man's true progress consists in deny ing himself, and the man who has denied himself is truly free and secure. The old ene my, however, setting himself against all good, never ceases to tempt them, but day and night plots dangerous snares to cast the unwary into the net of deceit. "W atch ye and pray," says the Lor d, "that ye enter not into temptation."37
