## Chapter 8: The Offering Of Christ On The Cross ; Our Offering

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
AS I offered Myself willingly to God t he Father for your sins with hands outstretched and body naked on the cross, so t hat nothing remained in Me that had not become a complete sacrifice to appease the di vine wrath, so ought you to be willing to offer yourself to Me day by day in the Ma ss as a pure and holy obla tion, together with all your faculties and affections, with as much inward devotion as you can. 
What more do I ask than that you give y ourself entirely to Me? I care not for anything else you may give Me, for I seek not your gift but you. Ju st as it would not be enough for you to have everything if you did not  have Me, so whatever you give cannot please Me if you do not give yourself. 
Offer yourself to Me, therefore, and give yourself entirely for God -- your offering will be accepted. Behold, I offered Myself who lly to the Father for you, I even gave My whole Body and Blood for food that I might be all yours, and you Mine forever. 
But if you rely upon self, and do not offer your free will to Mine, your offering will be incomplete and the union between us imperfect. Hence, if you desire to attain grace and freedom of heart, let the fr ee offering of yourself into the hands of God precede your every action. This is why so few are inwardly free and enlight ened -- they know not how to renounce themselves entirely. 
My word stands: "Everyone of you that doth not renounce all that he possesseth, cannot be My disciple."51 If, therefore, you wish to be My disciple, offer yourself to Me with all your heart.
