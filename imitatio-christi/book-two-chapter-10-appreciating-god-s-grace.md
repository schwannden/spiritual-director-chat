## Chapter 10: Appreciating God'S Grace

WHY do you look for rest when you were born to work? Resign yourself to patience rather than to comfort, to carrying your cro ss rather than to enjoyment.
What man in the world, if he could alwa ys have them, would not readily accept consolation and spiritual joy, benefits which ex cel all earthly delights and pleasures of the body? The latter, indeed, are either vain or base, while spiritual joys, born of virtue and infused by God into pure minds,  are alone truly pleasant and noble.
Now, since the moment of temptation is always nigh, since false freedom of mind and overconfidence in self are serious obsta cles to these visitations from heaven, a man can never enjoy them  just as he wishes.
God does well in giving the grace of consolation, but man does evil in not returning everything gratefully to God. Thus, the gifts of grace cannot flow in us when we are ungrateful to the Giver, when we do not  return them to the Fountainhead. Grace is always given to him who is duly grateful, and what is wont to be given the humble will be taken away from the proud.
I do not desire consolation that robs me of contrition, nor do I care for contemplation that leads to pride, for not all t hat is high is holy, nor is all that is sweet good, nor every desire pure, nor a ll that is dear to us pleasi ng to God. I accept willingly the grace whereby I become more humble and contrite, more willing to renounce self.
The man who has been taught by the gift of grace, and who learns by the lash of its withdrawal, will never dare to  attribute any good to himsel f, but will rather admit his poverty and emptiness. Give to God what is God's and ascribe to  yourself what is yours.
Give Him thanks, then, for His grace, but  place upon yourself alone the blame and the punishment your fault deserves.
Always take the lowest place and the highest will be given you, for the highest cannot exist apart from the lowest. The sain ts who are greatest before God are those who consider themselves the least, and the mo re humble they are within themselves, so much the more glorious they are. Since t hey do not desire vainglor y, they are full of truth and heavenly glory. Being establishe d and strengthened in God, they can by no means be proud. They attribute to God whatever good they have received; they seek no glory from one another but onl y that which comes from God alone. They desire above all things that He be praised in themselves and in all His saints -- this is their constant purpose.

16Apoc. 2:7.

Be grateful, therefore, for the least gift and you will be worthy to receive a greater. Consider the least gi ft as the greatest, the most contemptible as something special. And, if you but look to the digni ty of the Giver, no gift will appear too small or worthless. Even though He give punishm ents and scourges, accept them, because He acts for our welfare in whatev er He allows to befall us.
He who desires to keep the grace of God ought to be grat eful when it is given and patient when it is withdrawn. Let him pray  that it return; let him be cautious and humble lest he lose it.
