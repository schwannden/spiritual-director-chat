# BOOK THREE:

## Chapter 36: The Vain Judgments Of Men

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, trust firmly in the Lord, and do not fear the judgm ent of men when conscience tells you that you are upright and innocent. For it is good and blessed to suffer such things, and they will not weigh heav ily on the humble heart that trusts in God

rather than in itself. Many men say many thi ngs, and therefore little faith is to be put in them.
Likewise, it is impossible to satisfy all men.  Although Paul tried to please all in the Lord, and became all things to all men, yet he  made little of their opinions. He labored abundantly for the edification and salvation of others, as much as lay in him and as much as he could, but he could not escape being sometimes judged and despised by others. Therefore, he committed all to God Who knows all things, and defended himself by his patience and humility against the tongues of those who spoke unjustly or thought foolish things and lies, or made accusations  against him. Sometimes, indeed, he did answer them, but only lest his silence scandalize the weak.
Who are you, then, that y ou should be afraid of mortal man? Today he is here, tomorrow he is not seen. Fear God and you will not be afraid of the te rrors of men. What can anyone do to you by word or injury? He hurts himself rather than you, and no matter who he may be he cannot escape the judgment  of God. Keep God before your eyes, therefore, and do not qua rrel with peevish words.
If it seems, then, that you are worst ed and that you suffer undeserved shame, do not repine over it and do not le ssen your crown by impatience. Look instead to heaven, to Me, Who have power to deliver you from al l disgrace and injury, and to render to everyone according to his works.
