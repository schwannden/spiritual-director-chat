## Chapter 28: Strength Against Slander

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, do not take it to heart if so me people think badly of you and say unpleasant things about you. You ought to think worse things of yourself and to believe that no one is weaker than yourself. Moreover, if you walk in the spirit you will pay little heed to fleeting words. It is no small prudence to  remain silent in evil times, to turn inwardly to Me, and not to be disturbed by  human opinions. Do not let your peace depend on the words of men. Their thinking we ll or badly of you does not make you different from what you are. Where are tr ue peace and glory? Are they not in Me? He who neither cares to please men nor fears to  displease them will enjoy great peace, for all unrest and distraction of the senses aris e out of disorderly love and vain fear.
