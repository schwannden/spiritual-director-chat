## Chapter 58: High Matters And The Hidden Judgments Of God Are Not To Be Scrutinized

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, beware of discussing high ma tters and God's hidden judgments -- why this person is so forsaken and why that one is favored with so great a grace, or why one man is so afflicted and another so highly exalted. Such things are beyond all human understanding and no reason or disputation can fathom the judgments of God.
When the enemy puts such suggestions in your mind, therefore, or when some curious persons raise questions about them , answer with the prophet: "Thou art just, O Lord, and righteous are Thy judgments";40 and this: "The judgments of the Lord are true and wholly righteous."41 My judgments are to be fear ed, not discussed, because they are incomprehensible to the understanding of men.
In like manner, do not inquire or dispute about the merits  of the saints, as to which is more holy, or which shall be great er in the kingdom of heaven. Such things often breed strife and useless contentions. They nourish pride and vainglory, whence arise envy and quarrels, when one proudly tries to exalt one saint and the other another.
A desire to know and pry into such matters br ings forth no fruit. On the contrary, it displeases the saints, because I am the God, not  of dissension, but of peace -- of that peace which consists in true humility rather than in self-exaltation.
Some are drawn by the ardor of their love with greater affection to these saints or to those, but this affection is human and not divine. I am He who made all the saints. I gave them grace: I brought them to glory. I know the meri ts of each of them. I came before them in the blessings of My sw eetness. I knew My beloved ones before the ages. I chose them out of the world -- they di d not choose Me. I called them by grace, I drew them on by mercy. I led them safely through various temptations. I poured into them glorious consolations. I gave them perseverance and I crowned their patience. I know the first and the last. I embrace them all with love inestimable. I am to be praised in all My saints. I am to be blessed above all things, and honored in each of those whom I have exalted and predestined so gloriously wit hout any previous merits of their own.
He who despises one of the least of mine, therefore, do es no honor to the greatest, for both the small and the great I made. And he who disparages one of the saints disparages Me also and all others in  the kingdom of heaven. They are all one through the bond of charity. They have the same thought and the same will, and they mutually love one another; but, what is a much greater thing, they love Me more than themselves or their own merits. Rapt above themselves, and drawn beyond love of self, they are entirely absorbed in love of Me, in Whom they rest. There is nothing that can draw them away or depress t hem, for they who are filled wit h eternal truth burn with the fire of unquenchable love.

40Ps. 118:137.
41Ps. 18:10.

Therefore, let carnal and sensual men, who know only how to love their own selfish joys, forbear to disput e about the state of God's saints. Such men take away and add according to their own inclinations and not as it pleases the Eternal Truth. In many this is sheer ignorance, especially in thos e who are but little enlightened and can rarely love anyone with a purely spiritual love. They are still strongly drawn by natural affection and human friendship to one person or another, and on their behavior in such things here below are based their imaginings of heavenly things. But there is an incomparable distance between the things which the imperfect imagine and those which enlightened men contemplate through revelation from above.
Be careful, then, My child, of treati ng matters beyond your knowledge out of curiosity. Let it rather be your business and aim to be found, even though the least, in the kingdom of God. Fo r though one were to know who is more holy than another, or who is greater in the kingdom of heaven, of what value would this knowledge be to him unless out of it he should humble himself before Me and should rise up in greater praise of My name?
The man who thinks of the greatness of his own sins and the littleness of his virtues, and of the distance between himself and the perfection of the saints, acts much more acceptably to God than the one who argues about who is greater or who is less. It is better to invoke the saints with devout  prayers and tears, and with a humble mind to beg their glorious aid, than to search with vain inquisitiveness into their secrets.
The saints are well and perfectly c ontented if men know how to content themselves and cease their useless discussions. They do not glory in their own merits, for they attribute no good to themselves but all to Me, because out of My infinite charity I gave all to them. They are filled with such love of God and with such overflowing joy, that no glory is wanting to them and they can lack no happiness. All the saints are so much higher in glory as they are more humble in themselves; nearer to Me, and more beloved by Me. Therefore, you find it written that they cast their crowns before God, and fell down upon their faces before the Lam b, and adored Him Who lives forever.
Many ask who is the greater in the kingdom of heaven when they do not know whether they themselves shall be worthy  of being numbered among its least. It is a great thing to be even the least in heaven where all are great because all shall be called, and shall be, the child ren of God. The least shal l be as a thousand, and the sinner of a hundred years shall die. For when the disciples asked who should be greater in the kingdom of heaven they heard this response: "Unless you be converted and become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whosoever shall humble himself as this little child, he is the greater  in the kingdom of heaven."
42 Woe to those, therefore, who disdain to humble themselves willingly with the little children, for the low gate of  the heavenly kingdom  will not permit them to enter. Woe also to the rich who have their consolatio ns here, for when the poor enter into God's kingdom, they will stand outside la menting. Rejoice, you humble, and exult, you poor, for the kingdom of God is yours, if only you walk in the truth.



42Matt. 18:3, 4.
