# BOOK THREE:

## Chapter 9: All Things Should Be Referred To God As Their Last End

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, I must be your supreme and la st end, if you truly desire to be blessed. With this intention your affections , which are too often perversely inclined to self and to creatures, will be purified. For if you seek yourself in anything, you immediately fail interior ly and become dry of heart.
Refer all things principally to Me, therefor e, for it is I Who have given them all.
Consider each thing as flowing from the hi ghest good, and therefore to Me, as to their highest source, must all things be brought back.
From Me the small and the great, the poor and the rich dr aw the water of life as from a living fountain, and they who serve Me willingly and freely shall receive grace upon grace. He who wishes to glory in things  apart from Me, however, or to delight in some good as his own, shall not be grounded in true joy or gladden ed in his heart, but shall be burdened and distressed in many wa ys. Hence you ought not to attribute any good to yourself or ascribe virtue to any ma n, but give all to God without Whom man has nothing.
I have given all things. I will that all be returned to Me again, and I exact most strictly a return of thanks. This is the truth by which vainglor y is put to flight.
Where heavenly grace and true charity enter in, there neither envy nor narrowness of heart nor self-love will have plac e. Divine love conquers all and enlarges the powers of the soul.

If you are truly wise, you will rejoice only in Me, because no one is good except God alone, Who is to be praised above all things and above all to be blessed.
