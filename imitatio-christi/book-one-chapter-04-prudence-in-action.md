## Chapter 4: Prudence In Action

DO NOT yield to every impulse and suggestion but consider things carefully and patiently in the light of God's will. For very often, sad to  say, we are so weak that we believe and speak evil of other s rather than good. Perfect m en, however, do not readily believe every talebearer, because they know that human frailty is prone to evil and is likely to appear in speech. 
Not to act rashly or to cling obstinately to one's opinion, not to believe everything people say or to spread abroad the gossi p one has heard, is great wisdom. 
Take counsel with a wise and conscientious man. Seek the advice of your betters in preference to following your own inclinations. 
A good life makes a man wise according to God and gives him experience in many things, for the more humble he is and t he more subject to God, the wiser and the more at peace he will be in all things.
