## Chapter 56: We Ought To Deny Ourselves And Imitate Christ Through Bearing The

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, the more you depart from yourse lf, the more you will be able to enter into Me. As the giving up of exte rior things brings interior pea ce, so the forsaking of self unites you to God. I will have you lear n perfect surrender to My will, without contradiction or complaint.

Follow Me. I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Without the Way, there is no going. Without the Truth, there is no knowing. Without the Li fe, there is no living. I am the Way which you must follow, the Truth whic h you must believe, the Life for which you must hope. I am the inviolable Way, the in fallible Truth, the unendi ng Life. I am the Way that is straight, the supreme Truth, the Life that is true, the blesse d, the uncreated Life.
If you abide in My Way you shall know the Tr uth, and the Truth shall make you free, and you shall attain life everlasting.
If you wish to enter into life, keep My commandments. If you will know the truth, believe in Me. If you will be perfect, sell all. If you will be My disciple, deny yourself. If you will possess the blessed life, despise th is present life. If you will be exalted in heaven, humble yourself on earth. If you wish to reign with Me, carry the Cross with Me.
For only the servants of the Cross find t he life of blessedness and of true light.

THE DISCIPLE

Lord Jesus, because Your way is narrow and despised by the worl d, grant that I may despise the world and imitate You. For t he servant is not greater than his Lord, nor the disciple above the Master. Let Your servant  be trained in Your life, for there is my salvation and true holiness. Whatever else I read or hear does not fully refresh or delight me.

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

My child, now that you know these thi ngs and have read them all, happy will you be if you do them. He who has My commandm ents and keeps them, he it is that loves Me. And I will love him and will show Myself to  him, and will bring it about that he will sit down with Me in My Father's Kingdom.

THE DISCIPLE

Lord Jesus, as You have said, so be it, and what You have promised, let it be my lot to win. I have received the cross, from Your hand I have received it. I will carry it, carry it even unto death as You have laid it upon me. Truly, the life of a good religious man is a cross, but it leads to paradise. We have begun -- we may not go back, nor may we leave off.
Take courage, brethren, let us go forw ard together and Jesus will be with us. For Jesus' sake we have taken this cross. For Jesus' sake let us persevere with it. He will be our help as He is also our leader and gui de. Behold, our King goes before us and will fight for us. Let us follow lik e men. Let no man fear any te rrors. Let us be prepared to meet death valiantly in battle. Let us not suffer our glory to  be blemished by fleeing from the Cross.
