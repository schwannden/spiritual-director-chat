## Chapter 15: Works Done In Charity

NEVER do evil for anything in the world, or  for the love of any man. For one who is in need, however, a good work may at times be purposely left undone or changed for a better one. This is not the omission of a good deed but rather its improvement. 
Without charity external work is of no value, but anything done in charity, be it ever so small and trivial, is entirely fruitful inasmuch as God weighs the love with which a man acts rather than the deed itself. 
He does much who loves much. He does mu ch who does a thing well. He does well who serves the common good ra ther than his own interests. 
Now, that which seems to be charity is oftentimes really sensuality, for man's own inclination, his own will, his hope of reward, and his self-i nterest, are motives seldom absent. On the contrary, he who has  true and perfect charity seeks self in nothing, but searches all thi ngs for the glory of God. Moreover, he envies no man, because he desires no personal pleasure nor does he wish to rejoice in himself; rather he desires the greater gl ory of God above all things. He a scribes to man nothing that is good but attributes it wholly to God from Wh om all things proceed as from a fountain, and in Whom all the blessed shall re st as their last end and fruition. 
If man had but a spark of true charity he would surely s ense that all the things of earth are full of vanity!
