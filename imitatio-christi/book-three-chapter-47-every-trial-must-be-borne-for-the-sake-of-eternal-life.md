# BOOK THREE:

## Chapter 47: Every Trial Must Be Borne For The Sake Of Eternal Life

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, do not let the labors which you have taken up for My sake break you, and do not let troubles, from whatever source, cast you down; but in everything let My promise strengthen and console you. I am able to reward you beyond all means and measure.
You will not labor here long, nor will y ou always be oppressed by sorrows. Wait a little while and you will see a speedy end of evils. The hour will come when all labor and trouble shall be no more. All that pa sses away with time is trivial.
What you do, do well. Work faithfully in My vineyard. I will be your reward. Write, read, sing, mourn, keep sil ence, pray, and bear hardships like a man. Eternal life is worth all these and greater battles. Peace wi ll come on a day which is known to the Lord, and then there shall be no day  or night as at present but perpetual light, infinite brightness, lasting peace, and safe repose. T hen you will not say: "Who shall deliver me from the body of this deat h?" nor will you cry: "Woe is me, because my sojourn is prolonged." For then death will be banished, and there will be health unfailing. There will be no anxiety then, but blessed joy and sweet, noble companionship.
If you could see the everlasting crowns of the saints in heaven, and the great glory wherein they now rejoice -- they who were once considered contemptible in this world and, as it were, unworthy of life itself  -- you would certainly humble yourself at once to the very earth, and seek to be subjec t to all rather than to command even one.
Nor would you desire the pleasant days of this life, but rather be glad to suffer for God, considering it your greatest gai n to be counted as nothing among men.

Oh, if these things appealed to you and penetrated deeply into your heart, how could you dare to complain even once? Ought not all trials be borne for the sake of everlasting life? In truth, the loss or gain of God's ki ngdom is no small matter.
Lift up your countenance to heaven, then. Behold Me, and with Me all My saints.
They had great trials in this life, but now t hey rejoice. They are consoled. Now they are safe and at rest. And they shall abide with Me for all eternity in the kingdom of My Father.
