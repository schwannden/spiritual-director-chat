# BOOK THREE: 

## Chapter 8: Self-Abasement In The Sight Of God

THE DISCIPLE  
 
I WILL speak to my Lord, I who am but  dust and ashes. If I consider myself anything more than this, behold You stand agai nst me, and my sins bear witness to the truth which I cannot contradi ct. If I abase myself, however, if I humble myself to

nothingness, if I shrink from all self-esteem and account m yself as the dust which I am, Your grace will favor me, Your light will enshroud my heart, and all self-esteem, no matter how little, will sink in the depths of my nothingness to perish forever. 
It is there You show me to myself -- what  I am, what I have been, and what I am coming to; for I am nothing and I did not know it. Left to myself, I am nothing but total weakness. But if You look upon me for an in stant, I am at once made strong and filled with new joy. Great wonder it is that I, who of my own weight always sink to the depths, am so suddenly lifted up, and so graciously embraced by You. 
It is Your love that does this, gracious ly upholding me, supporting me in so many necessities, guarding me from so many grave dangers, and snatching me, as I may truly say, from evils without  number. Indeed, by loving myse lf badly I lost myself; by seeking only You and by truly loving You I have found both myself an d You, and by that love I have reduced myself more profoundly to nothing. For You, O sweetest Lord, deal with me above all my merits and above all that I dare to hope or ask. 
May You be blessed, my God, for alt hough I am unworthy of any benefits, yet Your nobility and infinite goodness never cease to do good even for those who are ungrateful and far from You. C onvert us to You, that we may be thankful, humble, and devout, for You are our salvation, our courage, and our strength.
