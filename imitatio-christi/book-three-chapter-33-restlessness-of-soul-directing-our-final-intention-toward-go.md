## Chapter 33: Restlessness Of Soul -- Directing Our Final Intention Toward God

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
MY CHILD, do not trust in your present feeling, for it will soon give way to another. As long as you live you will be subject to changeableness in spite of yourself. 
You will become merry at one time and sad at another, now peaceful but again disturbed, at one moment dev out and the next indevout, sometimes diligent while at other times lazy, now grave and again flippant. 
But the man who is wise and whose spirit is well instructed stands superior to these changes. He pays no attention to what he f eels in himself or from what quarter the wind of fickleness blows, so long as the whole intention of his mind is conducive to his proper and desired end. For thus he can stand undivided,  unchanged, and unshaken, with the singleness of his int ention directed unwaveringly toward Me, even in the midst of so many changing events. A nd the purer this singleness of intention is, with so much the more constancy does he pass through many storms. 
But in many ways the eye of pure intention grows dim, be cause it is attracted to any delightful thing that it meet s. Indeed, it is rare to find one who is entirely free from all taint of self-seeking. The Jews of old, fo r example, came to Bethany to Martha and Mary, not for Jesus' sake alone,  but in order to see Lazarus. 
The eye of your intention,  therefore, must be cleansed  so that it is single and right. It must be directed toward Me, despi te all the objects which may interfere.
