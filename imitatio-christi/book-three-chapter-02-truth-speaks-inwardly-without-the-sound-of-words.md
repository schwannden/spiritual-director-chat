## Chapter 2: Truth Speaks Inwardly Without The Sound Of Words

THE DISCIPLE

SPEAK, Lord, for Th y servant heareth."25 "I am Thy servant. Give me understanding that I may know Thine ordinances26 . . . Incline my heart to Thine ordinances27 . . . Let Thy speech distil as the dew."28

24Ps. 84:9.
251 Kings 3:9.

The children of Israel once said to Mose s: "Speak thou to us and we will hear thee: let not the Lord speak to us, lest we die."29 Not so, Lord, not so do I pray. Rather  with Samuel the prophet I entreat humbly and earnestly: "Speak, Lord, for Thy servant hear eth." Do not let Moses or any of the prophets speak to me; but You speak, O Lord  God, Who inspired and enlightened all the prophets; for You alone, wit hout them, can instruct me  perfectly, whereas they, without You, can do nothing. They, indeed, utte r fine words, but they  cannot impart the spirit. They do indeed speak beautifully, but if You remain silent they cannot inflame the heart. They deliver the message; You lay bare the sense. They place before us mysteries, but You unlock t heir meaning. They proclaim commandments; You help us to keep them. They point out the way; You give  strength for the jour ney. They work only outwardly; You instruct and enlighten our hearts . They water on the outside; You give the increase.
They cry out words; You give understanding to the hearer.
Let not Moses speak to me, therefore, but You, the Lord my God, everlasting truth, speak lest I die and prove barren if I am merely given outward advice and am not inflamed within; lest the word heard and not kept, known and not loved, believed and not obeyed, rise up in judgment against me.
Speak, therefore, Lord, for Your servant  listens. "Thou hast the words of eternal life."30 Speak to me for the comfort of my s oul and for the amendment  of my life, for Your praise, Your glory,  and Your everlasting honor.
