# BOOK THREE: 

## Chapter 6: The Proving Of A True Lover

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
MY CHILD, you are not yet a brave and wise lover. 
 
THE DISCIPLE  
 
Why, Lord? 
 
THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
Because, on account of a slight diffi culty you give up what you have undertaken and are too eager to seek consolation. 
The brave lover stands firm in temp tations and pays no heed to the crafty persuasions of the enemy. As I please him in prosperity, so in adversity I am not displeasing to him. The wise lover regards not so much the gift of Him Who loves as the love of Him Who gives. He regards the affection of the Giver rather  than the value of the gift, and sets his Beloved above all gifts. The noble lover does not rest in the gift but in Me Who am above every gift. 
All is not lost, then, if you sometimes f eel less devout than you wish toward Me or My saints. That good and sweet feeling whic h you sometimes have is the effect of present grace and a certain foretaste of yo ur heavenly home. You must not lean upon it too much, because it comes and goes. But to fight against evil thoughts which attack

you is a sign of virtue and great merit. Do no t, therefore, let str ange fantasies disturb you, no matter what they c oncern. Hold strongly to y our resolution and keep a right intention toward God. 
It is not an illusion that you are someti mes rapt in ecstasy and then quickly returned to the usual follies of your heart. For these are evils which you suffer rather than commit; and so long as they displease you and you struggle against them, it is a matter of merit and not a loss. 
You must know that the old enemy tries by  all means in his power to hinder your desire for good and to turn you from every devotional practice, especially from the veneration of the saints, fr om devout meditation on My pa ssion, and from your firm purpose of advancing in virtue. He suggests  many evil thoughts that he may cause you weariness and horror, and thus draw you away  from prayer and holy reading. A humble confession displeases him and,  if he could, he would make you omit Holy Communion. 
Do not believe him or heed him, even thoug h he often sets traps to deceive you. 
When he suggests evil, unclean things, accuse hi m. Say to him: "Away, unclean spirit! 
Shame, miserable creature! Y ou are but filth to bring such  things to my ears. Begone, most wretched seducer! You shall have no part in me, for Jesus will be my strength, and you shall be confounded. I would rather die and suffer all torments than consent to you. 
Be still! Be silent! Though you bring many troubles upon me I will have none of you. The Lord is my light, my salvation. Whom shall I fear? Though armies unite against me, my heart will not fear, for the Lord is  my Helper, my Redeemer." 
Fight like a good soldier and if you someti mes fall through weakness, rise again with greater strength than befor e, trusting in My most a bundant grace. But beware of vain complacency and pride. For many ar e led into error through these faults and sometimes fall into almost perpetual blindnes s. Let the fall of these, who proudly presume on self, be a warning to you and a constant incentive to humility.
