# BOOK THREE: 

## Chapter 12: Acquiring Patience In The Fight Against Concupiscence

THE DISCIPLE  
 
PATIENCE, O Lord God, is very necessa ry for me, I see, because there are many adversities in this life. No matter w hat plans I make for my own peace, my life cannot be free from struggle and sorrow. 
 
THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
My child, you are right, yet My wish is not that you seek that peace which is free from temptations or meets wit h no opposition, but rather that you consider yourself as having found peace when you have been torment ed with many tribulations and tried with many adversities. 
If you say that you cannot suffer much, how  will you endure the fire of purgatory? 
Of two evils, the lesser is always to be chosen.  Therefore, in order  that you may escape the everlasting punishments to come, try to bear present evils  patiently for the sake of God. 
Do you think that men of  the world have no suffering, or perhaps but little? Ask even those who enjoy the most delights and you will learn other wise. "But," you will say, "they enjoy many pleasures and follow their own wishes; therefore they  do not feel their troubles very much." Granted that they do have whatever they wish, how long do you think it will last? Behold, they who prosper in  the world shall peris h as smoke, and there shall be no memory of their past joys. Even in this life they do not find rest in these pleasures without bitterness, w eariness, and fear. For they o ften receive the penalty of sorrow from the very thing whence they bel ieve their happiness comes. And it is just. 
Since they seek and follow after pleasures without reason, they should not enjoy them without shame and bitterness. 
How brief, how false, how unreasonable and shameful all these pleasures are! 
Yet in their drunken blindness men do not understand this, but like brute beasts incur death of soul for the miserly enjoyment of a corruptible life. 
Therefore, My child, do not pursue your lusts, but turn away from your own will. 
"Seek thy pleasure in the Lord and He  will give thee thy heart's desires."33 If you wish to be truly delighted and more abundantly comfort ed by Me, behold, in contempt of all worldly things and in the cutting off of all base pleasures shall your blessing be, and great consolation shall be given you. Further , the more you withdraw  yourself from any solace of creatures, the sweeter and st ronger comfort will you find in Me. 
At first you will not gai n these blessings without sadness and toil and conflict. 
Habit already formed will resist you, but it shall be overcome by a better habit. The flesh will murmur against you, but it will be bridled by  fervor of spirit. The old serpent will sting and trouble you, but prayer will put him to fli ght and by steadfast, useful toil the way will be closed to him.
