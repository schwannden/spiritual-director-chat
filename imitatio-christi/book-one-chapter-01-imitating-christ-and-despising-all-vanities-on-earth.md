## Chapter 1: Imitating Christ And Despising All Vanities On Earth

HE WHO follows Me, walks not  in darkness," says the Lord.1 By these words of Christ we are advised to imitate His life and habits, if we wish to  be truly enlightened and free from all blindness of heart. Let our chief effort; therefore, be to study the life of Jesus Christ. 
The teaching of Christ is more excellent  than all the advice of the saints, and he who has His spirit will find in it a hidden m anna. Now, there are many who hear the Gospel often but care little for it because they  have not the spirit of Christ. Yet whoever wishes to understand fully the words of Christ must  try to pattern his whole life on that of Christ. 
What good does it do to speak learnedly about  the Trinity if, lacking humility, you displease the Trinity? Indeed it is not learning that makes a man holy and just, but a virtuous life makes him pleasing to  God. I would rather feel c ontrition than know how to define it. For what would it profit us to k now the whole Bible by heart and the principles of all the philosophers if we live without grace and the love of God? Vanity of vanities and all is vanity, except to love God and serve Him alone. 
This is the greatest wisdom -- to s eek the kingdom of heaven through contempt of the world. It is vanity, theref ore, to seek and trust in riches that perish. It is vanity also to court honor and to be puffed up with pride. It  is vanity to follow the lusts of the body and to desire things for which severe punishment later must come. It is  vanity to wish for long life and to care little about a well-spent life. It is vanity to be concerned with the present only and not to make provision for thi ngs to come. It is vanity to love what passes quickly and not to look ahead where eternal joy abides. 
Often recall the proverb: "The eye is not  satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing."2 Try, moreover, to turn your heart from  the love of things visible and bring yourself to things invisible. For they w ho follow their own evil passions stain their consciences and lose the grace of God.
