## Chapter 10: Avoiding Idle Talk

SHUN the gossip of men as much as possi ble, for discussion of worldly affairs, even though sincere, is a great distracti on inasmuch as we are quickly ensnared and captivated by vanity.
Many a time I wish that I had held my  peace and had not associated with men.
Why, indeed, do we converse and gossip am ong ourselves when we so seldom part without a troubled conscience? We do so bec ause we seek comfort from one another's conversation and wish to ease the mind weari ed by diverse thoughts. Hence, we talk and think quite fondly of things we like very mu ch or of things we dislike intensely. But, sad to say, we often talk vainly and to no pur pose; for this external  pleasure effectively bars inward and divine consolation.
Therefore we must watch and pray lest time pass idly.
When the right and opportune moment comes for speaking, say something that will edify.

Bad habits and indifference to spiritual progress do much to remove the guard from the tongue. Devout conver sation on spiritual matters, on the contrary, is a great aid to spiritual progress, especially when persons  of the same mind and spirit associate together in God.
