## Chapter 6: The Joy Of A Good Conscience

THE glory of a good man is the testimony of a good con science. Therefore, keep your conscience good and you will always enjo y happiness, for a good conscience can bear a great deal and can bring joy even in  the midst of adversity. But an evil conscience is ever restive and fearful.
Sweet shall be your rest if your heart does not reproach you.
Do not rejoice unless you have done well. Sinners never experi ence true interior joy or peace, for "there is no peace to the wicked," says the Lord.10 Even if they say:
"We are at peace, no evil sha ll befall us and no one dares to hurt us," do not believe them; for the wrath of God will arise quickly, and their deeds will be brought to naught and their thoughts will perish.
To glory in adversity is not hard for the m an who loves, for this is to glory in the cross of the Lord. But the glory given or received of men is short lived, and the glory of the world is ever companioned by sorrow. Th e glory of the good, however, is in their conscience and not in the lips of men, for the jo y of the just is from God and in God, and their gladness is founded on truth.
The man who longs for the true, eternal gl ory does not care for that of time; and he who seeks passing fame or does not in  his heart despise it, undoubtedly cares little for the glory of heaven.
He who minds neither praise nor blam e possesses great peace of heart and, if his conscience is good, he will easily be contented and at peace.
Praise adds nothing to your holiness, nor does blame take anything from it. You are what you are, and you cannot be said to be better than you are in God's sight. If you consider well what you are within, you will no t care what men say about you. They look to appearances but God looks to the heart. They consider the deed but God weighs the motive.
It is characteristic of a humble soul alwa ys to do good and to think little of itself. It is a mark of great purity and deep faith to look for no consolation in created things. The man who desires no justificati on from without has clearly entrusted himself to God: "For not he who commendeth himself is approved," says St. Paul, "but he whom God commendeth."
11 To walk with God interiorly, to be free from  any external affection -- this is the state of the inward man.
