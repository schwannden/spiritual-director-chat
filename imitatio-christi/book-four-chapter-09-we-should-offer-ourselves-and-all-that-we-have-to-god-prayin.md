## Chapter 9: We Should Offer Ourselves And All That We Have To God, Praying For All

THE DISCIPLE

ALL things in heaven and on earth, O Lord, ar e Yours. I long to give myself to You as a voluntary offering to remain forever Yours. With a sincere heart I offer myself this day to You, O Lord, to Your eternal service, to Your  homage, and as a sacrifice of everlasting praise. Receive me with this holy o ffering of Your precious Body which also I make to You this day, in the presence of angel s invisibly attending, for my salvation and that of all Your people.

51Luke 14:33.

O Lord, upon Your altar of expiation, I offer You all the sins and offenses I have committed in Your presence and in the presence of Your holy a ngels, from the day when I first could sin until this  hour, that You may burn and consume them all in the fire of Your love, that You may wipe away their every stain, cleanse my conscience of every fault, and restore to me Your grace which I lost  in sin by granting full pardon for all and receiving me mercifully with the kiss of peace.
What can I do for all my sins but hum bly confess and lament  them, and implore Your mercy without ceasing? In Your mer cy, I implore You, hear me when I stand before You, my God. All my sins are most displeasing to me. I wish never to commit them again. I am sorry for t hem and will be sorry as long as  I live. I am ready to do penance and make satisfaction to the utmost of my power.
Forgive me, O God, forgive me my sins fo r Your Holy Name. Save my soul which You have redeemed by Your most precious Blood.  See, I place myself at Your mercy. I commit myself to Your hands. Deal with me according to Your goodness, not according to my malicious and evil ways.
I offer to You also all the good I have, small and imperfect though it be, that You may make it more pure and more holy, t hat You may be pleased with it, render it acceptable to Yourself, and perfect it more and more, and finally that You may lead me, an indolent and worthless creature, to a good and happy end.
I offer You also all the holy desires of Your devoted servants, the needs of my parents, friends, brothers, sist ers, and all who are dear to me; of all who for Your sake have been kind to me or to others; of a ll who have wished and asked my prayers and Masses for them and theirs, whether they yet live in the flesh or are now departed from this world, that they may all experience t he help of Your grace, the strength of Your consolation, protection from dangers, deliv erance from punishment to come, and that, free from all evils, they may gladly give abundant thanks to You.
I offer You also these prayers and the Sacrifice of Propitiation for those especially who have in any way injured, saddened, or slandered me, inflicted loss or pain upon me, and also for all those whom I have at any time saddened, disturbed, offended, and abused by word or deed,  willfully or in ignorance. May it please You to forgive us all alike our sins and offenses against one another.
Take away from our hearts, O Lord, all suspicion, anger, wrath, contention, and whatever may injure charity and lessen brotherly love. Have  mercy, O Lord, have mercy on those who ask Your mercy, give grace to  those who need it, and make us such that we may be worthy to enjoy Y our favor and gain eternal life.
