# BOOK THREE: 

## Chapter 24: Avoiding Curious Inquiry About The Lives Of Others

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
MY CHILD, do not be curious. Do not troubl e yourself with idle cares. What matters this or that to  you? Follow Me. What is it to you if a man is such and such, if another does or says this or that? You will not have to answer for others, but you will have to give an account of yourself. Why,  then, do you meddle in their affairs? 
Behold, I know all men. I see everythi ng that is done under the sun, and I know how matters stand with each -- what is in his mind and what in his heart and the end to which his intention is directed. Commit all th ings to Me, therefore,  and keep yourself in good peace. Let him who is disturbed be as rest less as he will. Whatever he has said or done will fall upon himself, for he cannot deceive Me. 
Do not be anxious for the shadow of a gr eat name, for the cl ose friendship of many, or for the particular a ffection of men. These things  cause distraction and cast great darkness about the heart. I would willingly speak My word and reveal My secrets to you, if you would watch diligently fo r My coming and open your heart to Me. Be prudent, then. Watch in prayer, and in all things humble yourself.
