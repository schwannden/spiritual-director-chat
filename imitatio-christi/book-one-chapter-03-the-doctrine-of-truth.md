## Chapter 3: The Doctrine Of Truth

HAPPY is he to whom truth manifests itself, not in si gns and words that fade, but as it actually is. Our opinions, our senses often deceive us and we discern very little.
What good is much discussion of involved and obscure matters when our ignorance of them will not be held against us on Judgment Day? Neglect of things which are profitable and necessary and undue concer n with those which are irrelevant and harmful, are great folly.
We have eyes and do not see.
What, therefore, have we to do with ques tions of philosophy? He to whom the Eternal Word speaks is free from  theorizing. For from this Word are all things and of Him all things speak -- the Beginning Who also speaks to us. Without this Word no man

understands or judges aright. He to whom it becomes everythi ng, who traces all things to it and who sees all things in it, may ease his heart and remain at peace with God.
O God, You Who are the trut h, make me one with You in love everlasting. I am often wearied by the many things I hear and read,  but in You is all that I long for. Let the learned be still, let all creat ures be silent before You; You alone speak to me.
The more recollected a man is, and the more simple of heart he becomes, the easier he understands sublime things, for he receives the light of knowledge from above. The pure, simple, and steadfast spirit is not distracted by many labors, for he does them all for the honor of God. A nd since he enjoys interior peace he seeks no selfish end in anything. What, indeed, gives more trouble and affliction than uncontrolled desires of the heart?
A good and devout man arranges in his mind the things he has to do, not according to the whims of evil inclination but according to the dictates of right reason.
Who is forced to struggle more than he who tr ies to master himself? This ought to be our purpose, then: to conquer se lf, to become stronger each day, to advance in virtue.
Every perfection in this life has some imperfection mixed with it and no learning of ours is without some darkness. Humble k nowledge of self is a surer path to God than the ardent pursuit of l earning. Not that learning is to be considered evil, or knowledge, which is good in itself and so ordained by God; but a clean conscience and virtuous life ought always to be preferred. Many often err and accomplish little or nothing because they try to become learned rather than to live well.
If men used as much care in uprooting vices and implanting virtues as they do in discussing problems, there would not be so mu ch evil and scandal in the world, or such laxity in religious organizations. On the day  of judgment, surely, we shall not be asked what we have read but what we have done; not  how well we have spoken but how well we have lived.
Tell me, where now are all the masters and teachers whom you knew so well in life and who were famous for their learning? Others have already taken their places and I know not whether they ever think of t heir predecessors. During life they seemed to be something; now they are seldom remem bered. How quickly the glory of the world passes away! If only their lives had kept pace with their learning, then their study and reading would have been worth while.
How many there are who perish because of vain worldly knowledge and too little care for serving God. They became vain in t heir own conceits because they chose to be great rather than humble.
He is truly great who has great charity. He  is truly great who is little in his own eyes and makes nothing of the highest honor . He is truly wise who looks upon all earthly things as folly that he may gain Christ. He who does God's will and renounces his own is truly very learned.
