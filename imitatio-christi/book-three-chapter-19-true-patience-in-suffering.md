# BOOK THREE: 

## Chapter 19: True Patience In Suffering

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
 
WHAT are you saying, My child? Think of My suffering and that of the saints, and cease complaining. You have not yet resisted to the shedding of blood. What you suffer is very little compared with the great things they suffered who were so strongly tempted, so severely troubled, so tried and torment ed in many ways. Well may you remember, therefore, the very painful woes of others, that you may bear your own little ones the more easily. And if they do not seem so small to you, examine if perhaps your impatience is not the cause of their apparent greatness; and whether they are great or small, try to bear them  all patiently. The better you dispos e yourself to suffer, the more wisely you act and the greater is the reward  promised you. Thus you will suffer more easily if your mind and habits are diligently trained to it. 
Do not say: "I cannot bear this from such a man, nor should I suff er things of this kind, for he has done me a great wrong. He has  accused me of many things of which I never thought. However, from someone else I will gladly suffer as much as I think I should." 
Such a thought is foolish, for it does not  consider the virtue of patience or the One Who will reward it, but rather weighs the person and the offense committed. The man who will suffer only as much as seems good to him, who will accept suffering only from those from whom he is pl eased to accept it, is not trul y patient. For the truly patient man does not consider from whom the suffering comes, whether from a superior, an

equal, or an inferior, whether from a good and holy person or from a perverse and unworthy one; but no matter how great an advers ity befalls him, no matter how often it comes or from whom it comes, he accept s it gratefully from  the hand of God, and counts it a great gain. For wit h God nothing that is suffered for His sake, no matter how small, can pass without reward . Be prepared for the fight, t hen, if you wish to gain the victory. Without struggle you cannot obtain the cr own of patience, and if you refuse to suffer you are refusing the crown. But if you desire to be crowne d, fight bravely and bear up patiently. Without labor there is no rest, and without fighting, no victory. 
 
THE DISCIPLE  
 
O Lord, let that which seem s naturally impossible to me become possible through Your grace. You know that I can suffer very  little, and that I am quickly discouraged when any small adversity arises. Let the torm ent of tribulation suffered for Your name be pleasant and desirable to me, since to su ffer and be troubled for Your sake is very beneficial for my soul.
