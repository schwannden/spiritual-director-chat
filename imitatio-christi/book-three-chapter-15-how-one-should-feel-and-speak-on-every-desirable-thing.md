## Chapter 15: How One Should Feel And Speak On Every Desirable Thing

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

MY CHILD, this is the way you must s peak on every occasion: "Lord, if it be pleasing to You, so be it. If it be to Your  honor, Lord, be it done in Your name. Lord, if You see that it is expedient and profitable for me, then grant that I may use it to Your honor. But if You know that it will be harmf ul to me, and of no good benefit to the welfare of my soul, then take this desire away from me."
Not every desire is from the Holy Spir it, even though it may seem right and good.
It is difficult to be certain whether it is a good spirit or a bad one that prompts one to this or that, and even to know whether you are being moved by your own spirit. Many who seemed at first to be led by a good sp irit have been deceived in the end.
Whatever the mind sees as good, ask and desire in fear of  God and humility of heart. Above all, commit the w hole matter to Me with true resignation, and say: "Lord, You know what is better for me; let this be done or that be done as You please. Grant what You will, as much as Y ou will, when You will. Do with me as You know best, as will most please You, and will be for Your great er honor. Place me where You will and deal with me freely in all things. I am in Your  hand; turn me about whichever way You will.
Behold, I am Your servant, ready to obey in a ll things. Not for myself do I desire to live, but for You -- would that I could do this worthily and perfectly!"

A PRAYER THAT THE WILL OF GOD BE DONE

Grant me Your grace, O mo st merciful Jesus, that it may be with me, and work with me, and remain with me to the very end.  Grant that I may always desire and will that which is most acceptable and pleasing to You. Let Your will be mine. Let my will always follow Yours and agree perfectly with i t. Let my will be one with Yours in willing and in not willing, and let me be unable to will or  not will anything but what You will or do not will. Grant that I may die to  all things in this world, and for Your sake love to be despised and unknown in this life. Give me above all desires the desire to rest in You, and in You let my heart have peace. You are tr ue peace of heart. You alone are its rest.
Without You all things are difficult and troubled . In this peace, the selfsame that is in You, the Most High, the everlasting G ood, I will sleep and take my rest. Amen.
