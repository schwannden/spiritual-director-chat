# BOOK ONE: 

## Chapter 9: Obedience And Subjection

IT IS a very great thing to obey, to live under a superior and not to be one's own master, for it is much safer to be subject t han it is to command. Many live in obedience more from necessity than from love. Su ch become discontented and dejected on the slightest pretext; they will never gain peace of mind unless they subject themselves wholeheartedly for the love of God. 
Go where you may, you will find no rest except in humble obedience to the rule of authority. Dreams of happi ness expected from change and different places have deceived many. 
Everyone, it is true, wishes to do as he pleases and is attracted to those who agree with him. But if God be among us, we mu st at times give up our opinions for the blessings of peace. 
Furthermore, who is so wise that he c an have full knowledge of everything? Do not trust too much in your own opinions, but  be willing to listen to those of others. If, though your own be good, you accept another's opinion for love of God, you will gain much more merit; for I have often heard that it is safer to listen to advice and take it than to give it. It may happen, t oo, that while one's own opini on may be good, refusal to agree with others when reason and occasion demand it, is a sign of pride and obstinacy.
