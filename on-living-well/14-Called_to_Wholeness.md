# Called to Wholeness

time, we fall into the grip of an idea, or embrace a behavior that we think
is absolutely indispensable for pleasing God, and proving our worth to Him. Often these ideas and behaviors are completely admirable. The Ten Commandments, for instance.

Who would find fault with any of us, for trying our best to keep them? And who wouldn't admire us if we succeeded? Jesus finds fault, believe it or not. We get no praise from Him at all. In fact, He attacks.

He mounts an assault on our moral ideas and our exemplary behavior, which we characteristically
construct around us to protect us from having dealings with a personal God, and his love,
his mercy, and his purposes of salvation in our lives. One of the most common ways we avoid God
is to try to be so good that he will let us alone to be our own gods and lend life the way that
suits us best. But Jesus won't let us get away with it.

He wants us, our hearts, and our warm
love-faith relationships with him, not icily correct moral performances before him. Jesus is
famous for the words of comfort that he spoke. Many people yell at us when we get in their way
and curse us when we interfere with their plans.

The verbal flagellations hurt. We are wounded and
degraded. We are humiliated and embarrassed. Words are weapons that can injure and cripple us. The words of Jesus never do that. He is a master at using words in such a way that our very beings
are called into wholeness.

We listen to him and find ourselves sane and our dignity restored. But while Jesus's words are always hope-giving and love-deepening, they are not always soothing. Sometimes they are absolutely heartbreaking.

Sometimes they are hammer blows that shatter
some fond but wrong idea that we cherish, that demolish some dear idol that we don't think we
can live without. When that happens, it is as if our spiritual hearts contract a disease that
interferes with our capacity to vigorously respond to God. Our inner muscles lose their elasticity,
becoming leathery and hard.

Jesus cures us of this condition with heartbreaking words that break up
the hardness and restore a supple and easy responsiveness to our souls. He wants something
more of us than mere goodness, and his words are meant to call us into love. The Unspeakable Ordinary
