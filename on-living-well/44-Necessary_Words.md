# Necessary Words

When the word is
preached or taught, said or sung, prayed or meditated, that is not the end of it. God
continues to watch over this word, tending it, and caring for it until it brings forth love,
obedience, hope, belief, or joy. And we watch with him.

Not as spectators at a ballgame,
but as shepherds of a flock, as parents of a child, as lovers and friends. Watching for signs
of grace, watching for movements of joy, watching for evidence that once again, the word has become
flesh. Watching over the word is neither obvious nor easy, but it is necessary.

And because it is
not obvious or easy but is necessary, the Church ordains ministers of the word to also be ministers
of the sacrament, to spot the connections, to doggedly stay with the people to whom the
word has been proclaimed, praying persistently and vigilantly with them and for them, to
alertly watch over this word of God until it becomes the performance of God. It is so easy to miss this part. It is so easy to proclaim this word and then walk off and do something else, to get distracted,
to get busy.

But God has promised that he is going to watch over this word, to perform it. We need to stick around and see what happens, and pastors need to lead their congregations
to stick around and see what happens, to see how God performs this word. Congregations are great wanderers.

Ten minutes after having heard the word of God, they lose interest and turn on the television
or go shopping or eat a snack. And then they are not around to witness the performance of the word.
