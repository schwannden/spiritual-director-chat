# This Is the Boldness

in which we should participate we must be bold in admitting
who we are people who fall far short of god's will and who often are active accomplices in
plans to thwart or destroy his will if at any time we fail to do this we become self-righteous
arrogant pontifical and almost insufferable to those outside the church
Early in the service of worship, many Christians say a prayer of confession. Not to condemn or
make themselves feel low and worthless, but to get the whole human affair into perspective,
and have a base from which to work. This confession is important, but we must be
equally bold in proclaiming God's mighty acts.

God raised him up. Acts chapter 2 verse 24. It is for this we exist. To tell a world already full of doubt, skepticism, contradictory evidence,
hopelessness, sorrow and death. That God is the creator and redeemer.

That God loves his creatures
and will redeem and restore them to full health and fellowship with himself. This is the boldness
that our time, more than most, needs us to proclaim.
