# On Doing Less

is from experiences
we've accumulated in our early years of growing up. Some of us learned then that being good daughters or sons, being good boys or girls, and helping
out, in some way or other, picking up the trash, doing the dishes, making our beds,
or sharing our toys. We began life being taken care of totally, and gradually learned to take care of ourselves,
believing our parents of those duties, and then went on to take care of others.

But being Christians is nearly the opposite of that. Being Christians means letting God take care of us, totally. We usually begin by trying to find out what we can do to help, expecting as we go along
that we will take on more and more responsibility, getting busier and busier in the Lord's service.

What we find, though, is that as we become practiced in the practices of prayer and worship
and trust and love, we are more and more receivers, and our lives are experienced as
gifts, as grace. There is a paradox here. The less busy we are, the more free we are to do the essentially Christian acts.

The less we hassle ourselves and one another with jobs, lists, and endless moralistic housecleaning,
the more focused we become for truly productive lives of creation and vocation. The less we do, the more we find our Lord the Spirit doing in and through us.
