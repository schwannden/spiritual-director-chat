# On Seeds

God is the seed of the Christian. The parable of the sower,
see Matthew chapter 13, explains this with unforgettable clarity. The Word comes into
our lives with divine power and can, if received rightly, multiply and produce itself in a great
harvest to God's glory.

The Word of God puts reason, strength, direction, and sense into a
Christian's life, and from that point, it is possible for the person to live a new life in
Christ, or Christ lives in her. The Word of God is a seed, and as it germinates and grows, the result
is the Christian. But the Christian is the seed of the Church.

The Christian is to the Church what
the Word of God is to the Christian, or analogously, what the seed is to the plant full-grown. The Church is not just an aggregate of Christians. It is not simply a collective term for talking
easily about many individuals who have similar beliefs about God.

The Church is an entity
all its own. It has an organic life, with a particular spiritual shape, characteristics,
and qualities. All this is not visible, of course, in either the Church or the Christian.

Just by looking, it is impossible to tell if someone is a Christian, because the life
of Christ is a hidden life. It is revealed in many particular visible expressions true,
but its essence is hidden. The same is true with the Church.

Visibly, it looks like a
society or institution made up of component parts, individuals who are subscribing to
generally harmonious policy or belief. But from the word of God, we know something else is really
taking place. It is an organic, spiritual body, with Christ as head, and all of us as members.

As we are incorporated into it, we live lives, not our own. We become participants,
in the church's life. We become, seeds.
