# On Living It Up

gone?
Has life become, as James Michener suggested, a falling away, a gradual surrender of the
dream? It has for many.
Morals get flabby. Goals lose their magnetism. Imagination goes slack. But no one was created to live listlessly.

No one is fated to boredom. God did not design this marvelous creation and invest us with eternal hungers and thirsts
with the expectation that we would sit around and in fatigued voices ask, what's next? Living the good life, philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev is said to have written, is frequently dull
and flat and commonplace.

Our greatest problem, he claimed, is to make it fiery and creative
and capable of spiritual struggle. Jesus, in his parables and example, wakes us up to
the central vitalities of life, the realities that provoke intensity and participation and
commitment. His example prompts us to live upward toward God, to live on tiptoe, to live
in such a way that our lives increase and develop with the energies of God's grace.

Christ's way of life is a holy attack on everything that leaks the brightness out of our lives
or detracts from the promised joy of our faith. It demolishes anything that promises liberation,
but in fact, imprisons us in boredom. Following him evokes a life pursued heartily and meaningfully.
