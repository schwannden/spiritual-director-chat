# Do It Yourself

eized with
a conviction that i had to learn to play the five-string banjo the next day i went to the
pawn shops on east baltimore street and found a banjo for seven dollars i then went to the music
shops around peabody and found a used instruction book for five dollars picking and strumming i set
myself to learning how to play some of those around me heard the unhappy results of my enthusiasm
my reason for being in baltimore at the time was to study at johns hopkins university preparing to
be a teacher of scripture. I remember thinking, I hope that when I stand in a pulpit or at a
lectern with the scriptures in my hands, that something similar will happen to the people who
hear me as happened to me as I heard Pete Seeger. A fierce determination to read the Bible and enjoy
it themselves.

The distinctive thing in that experience was not that I wanted to go back and
hear Pete Seeger sing again, but that I wanted to do it myself. That is what pastors should want to
take place when they teach and preach the scriptures. Not to have people become dependent
on them, but to have people become eager to get the Bible in their own hands and become competent
in reading it.
