# On Shouting for Crumbs

ame out and started shouting,
Have mercy on me, Lord, son of David, my daughter is tormented by a demon. But he did not answer her
at all, and his disciples came and urged him, saying, Send her away, for she keeps shouting
after us. Matthew chapter 15, verses 22 to 23.

The woman had chutzpah, and that catches our
attention. She badgered Jesus to the point of irritation, and nagged him into compassion. St. Matthew told her story in his gospel, and opened a dimension of experience that
we often suppress.

Maybe we don't have to compose ourselves into postures of reverence before we pray. Maybe we don't have to know very much about the strategies of salvation before we appeal
for help. Maybe when we feel excluded from the rich banquet of life that everyone else seems to
have such easy access to, we need to push our way into the room, elbow our way to the
head table, and demand at least a portion of the leftovers.

This is not the polite approach to Jesus that we are taught by our pastors and parents,
but it worked once. Maybe it will work again. A lavish God.
