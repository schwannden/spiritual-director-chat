# On the Overlook

ecause
they are so large. Such as when people who live at the base of a huge mountain never look at it
anymore, although they did often enough when they were children. But the mountain is the most
significant geographical feature in their lives, shaping the weather, determining the soil,
marking boundaries.

God is huge in that way. Obvious, essential, inescapable. But even more
so, for he is also personal and passionate, and gracious and merciful. His outer largeness,
the heavens are telling the glory of God, Psalm 19, verse 1, is matched by an inner
largeness.

The joy of your salvation, Psalm 51, verse 12. We've all seen it, exclaimed
over it, and been changed by it. But year after year of living in a world of such magnitude
makes it easy to quit seeing it, and to lose awareness of God, and the urgent and everyday
business of getting across the street, without getting hit by an 18-wheeler.

That is why
we work together as a community, to have awareness of the great presence of God in our lives. We seek to wake ourselves up, to make sure that the roar of the vacuum cleaner doesn't
drown out the knock of the treasure desk at the door. To deliberately step out of the
fast lane, so that we can see and hear and touch the God who is around and within us,
and can shut up long enough, so that we hear and truly listen to the story of God coming
to us, born in Jesus, born in us.

On being biblical.
