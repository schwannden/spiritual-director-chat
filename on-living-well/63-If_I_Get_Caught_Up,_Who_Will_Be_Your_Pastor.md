# If I Get Caught Up, Who Will Be Your Pastor?

name god accurately so that you will know the basic reality of your existence and know
what's going on and i want to say that name personally alongside and with you in the actual
circumstances of your lives so that you will recognize and respond to the god who is both on
your side and at your side when it doesn't seem like it when you don't feel as though it's true
Why do I have such a difficult time keeping this focus? Why am I so easily distracted? One reason is that I am asked to do many things other than this, most of which seem useful and
important.

The world of religion generates a huge market for meeting all the needs that don't get
met in the shopping mall. Pastors are conspicuous in this religious marketplace and are expected to
come up with products that give customer satisfaction. The needs seem legitimate enough,
and since I'm the one being asked, I fall into the practice of merchandising, moral advice,
and religious comfort.

Before long, I find that I am the program director of a flourishing business. I spend my time figuring out ways to attractively display God products. I become skilled at
pleasing the customers. Before I realize what has happened, the mystery and love and majesty of God
are obliterated by the noise and frenzy of the religious marketplace.

But then, who will say
the name God in such a way that the community can see him for who he is, our Lord and Savior,
and not something neatly packaged and priced to meet our consumer needs? And who will have the
time to stand with you in the places of confusion and darkness and hurt, long enough to discern the
healing and salvation being worked out, behind the scenes, under the surface? If I get all caught up
running the store.

Who will be your pastor?
