# On Thinking and Thanking

n meaning.
Thinking is a work of the mere intellect. Thanking is an expression of the whole person. Thanking that is not preceded by thinking is shallow and inadequate. But thinking that does not transform to thanking is arid and sterile.

It is our acts of gratitude that complete our processes of worship and remembrance. We recollect all that has happened among us by Christ's design. We praise the Lord who makes our lives, like all things, work together for good.

Is there any other place in our society where so much is remembered and praised as here
among Christians in worship, where there is such a concentration of memory and such exuberance
and gratitude? I think not.
