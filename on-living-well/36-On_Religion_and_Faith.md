# On Religion and Faith

find religion, institutions, creeds, documents, artifacts, and the like. But he may not find faith. Faith is deeply personal, dynamic, and ultimate. Religion, however, is faith's expression. For example, religion is concerned about institutions, churches, documents, statements of belief,
Bible and theology, and our convictions and moral codes.

Religion is important, but not ultimately important. Religion is a means, not an end. Faith is the only end.
