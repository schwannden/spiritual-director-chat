# Getting Out the News

it is his will that we experience his love and that jesus christ provides the way in
which we get in on it saved is the usual term for it many people don't understand this good news
they don't know that god is for them and they don't know the way and are wasting their lives
hunting and pecking guessing and groping hoping that they will get lucky someday with a lottery
ticket to heaven. But as Christians, we know that God is for us, and know the way to receive him in
Jesus. We don't know everything about these great issues, but we know at least that much.

And we
know that it is both our obligation and our joy to tell others. G.K. Chesterton once turned a well-known
aphorism on its head. If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly. I think of that in regard
to evangelism.

Not many of us think of ourselves as experts in it. Mostly we are aware of our
omissions, our missed opportunities, and our negligence. We sometimes associate the action
of evangelism with football stadium crowds and television glamour.

But most evangelism is
incremental and unobtrusive. Most evangelism takes place in the world, as Christians live
and work alongside one another in families and at jobs, over the course of 10 and 20 and 30 years. The primary field for evangelism is not with strangers who cross our lives briefly,
but with the people with whom we live and work and socialize over a lifetime.

That is why it
is so difficult. We must learn how to communicate, through the ordinariness of our lives, the
extraordinariness of God's grace. We need constant stimuli and direction, in both what to say,
and how to say it right, with our words and our lives.

Still, it takes place. The news is getting out.
