# Wisdom? Wealth?

guarantee the good life
Our thinking power and our earning power combined are not enough to usher in utopia. This in no way detracts from the usefulness or desirability of intelligence and wealth. Education is certainly one of the major liberating factors in our civilization,
and prosperity is a major benefit.

In Solomon's life, his wisdom and wealth were admired rather
than despised. But they were not capable of freeing him from his sins and bringing the
rule of God to the people. There was a central omission, and because of that defect, nothing
worked out.

Then his wisdom turned to folly and his wealth to decadence. With all his gifts,
Solomon failed to do what the shorter catechism says we must do—glorify God and enjoy him forever. We have particular reason for noting Solomon's life, for we today are facing similar possibilities.

Because of the culture we live in, each one of us has a good chance of being both wealthy and wise. We know a lot, and we have a lot. Yet there are many indications that we are not using our wisdom
and wealth according to God's will.

There are large pockets of poverty in our land. The world
has millions of hungry people. Surely it is not the will of God that people be hopelessly trapped
in desperate poverty at a time when our culture as a whole has become one of affluence and abundance.

Beyond economics, beyond politics, this is an issue of love, or the deplorable lack of it. You must look for a deeper reason for living than simply acquiring better educations and better jobs
and more wisdom and more wealth. We must seek a more substantial means of glorifying God,
deeper wisdom, and a greater amount of wealth than Solomon's.

We must take steps to protect
ourselves from Solomon's paradox, the outward signs of wisdom and wealth that cover up an inward
stupidity and a social poverty. That means that we will have to begin not on the outside, but on
the inside, not with the superstructure, but with the foundation. We begin with ourselves as creatures
of God and seek his wisdom and wealth at our deepest levels of being.

We seek them through
Jesus Christ. Saint John spoke of our Lord as the Word of God, that is, the intelligence or the
rationality of God. He also called him the Glory of God. The word glory in Hebrew, kabod, means
much the same as wealth, solid wealth.

We speak of receiving Christ into our hearts, receiving
God's kindness and nearness within our own existence. When we do this voluntarily, the
word of God and the glory of God, his truth and his grace, his wisdom and his wealth, become
implanted as life principles within us. Our lives begin to reflect the rationality of divinity and
the solid wealth of eternity.

It still may not be judged as either wisdom or wealth by this world. Our Lord died poor and reckoned by Pilate as a fool, but we will be wise in the counsel of God
and inheritors of the riches of a new heaven and new earth.
