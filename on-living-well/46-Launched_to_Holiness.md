# Launched to Holiness

that people don't go to church the way they
used to. Worshipping God is no longer a priority in people's lives. Sunday morning is self-indulgence time, a time to take it easy, and a chance to treat
number one to some quality time.

And what a lot of options there are. Strolls, entertainment, visits to zoos and museums, sunning on the beach, fishing, smelling
the flowers. Is it any wonder that worship no longer takes top billing on Sunday mornings?

But my voice will not be heard among the laments. I am astonished that anybody worships at all. What are all these people doing in church each Sunday? Why on earth be here, when they have all
these attractive and promising options?

Going to church on a Sunday morning made sense when
everybody in the village did it, when the pressure of tradition and the custom of centuries dictated
it, and the pastor exercised powerful moral authority over the entire community. Besides,
what else was there to do on a Sunday morning? But now people have options, well-advertised,
socially sanctioned options, any one of which promises more zip than an hour of worship.

In the face of the formidable competition, why do all these people, millions of them every week,
keep showing up to worship God? I'm far more astonished that people do come than distressed
that they don't. Why do they do it? Why do we do it?

It is simple. We come to see, to get our
vision cleared of the ugliness and trash, so that we can see what God is doing at the heart of it. We come to hear, to clear our ears of the noise of anger and lust that pollute the atmosphere,
and to listen to love spoken to our hearts, forgiveness to our sins, mercy to our failures,
and grace to our needs. We come to touch, to break through the social makeup and protective
role-playing, and touch one another in greetings of welcome and acceptance.

And we come to speak,
not words that flatter or sell or manipulate, but ones that speak what we most deeply are and feel,
that honestly confess our sin, and that reverently sing our praise. Lives turn around, open up,
and come alive in the act of worship. For evidence of this life, look at Isaiah.

Isaiah was one of
the most wide-awake, in-touch, well-spoken people ever. It all started for him in an act of worship. He knew what was going on around him, in the city, in politics, and in people. He also knew what was
going on inside him, and inside the events of the day.

He knew what God was doing. He saw the
holiness, he heard the commands, he felt the cleansing, and he spoke his commitment to the
faith. The facts reported in the newspapers and described in our textbooks are real enough,
but they are the minuscule edge of reality.

There is far, far more. Worship launches us
into the rich, invisible inflow of holiness, the action and word of God. Three short thoughts on direction. All life is a pilgrimage.
