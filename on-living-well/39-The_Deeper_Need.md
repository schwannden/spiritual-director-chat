# The Deeper Need

saw the prosperity of the wicked. Psalm 73, verses 2-3
I don't yet have what I want. My life is a kind of need factory that runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The need for food that was satisfied with a bowl of oatmeal at breakfast is back again
at noon, demanding soup and a sandwich.

The need for clothing, that not only warms but also enhances and expresses who I am,
requires periodic fashionable updating, to meet my insatiable need for social approval. People around me, finding out that I have these needs, find ways to exploit them. They do it to make money.

Quite clearly, they stimulate my sense of need and then channel it, into ways that they
promise to meet for a price. The need they start with is usually legitimate, but then it is distorted and twisted into
rampant and out-of-control greed. A waiting heart, deliberately interrupts this process, in which our needs become corrupted
by covetousness.

We are returned to our basic needs, our God-need, and are directed to take care of that. Fundamentally, we take care of it by praying. With God as the first item on our lists of needs, we are directed to prayer, where we
deal with God personally, truly, the only way he can be dealt with.

We pray.
And as we pray out our God need, we find to our surprise that it doesn't go away. The need remains.
It not only remains, but also deepens. And so we find ourselves waiting. For wholeness.
For the coming of Christ.

Waiting can make us impatient and irritable, or it can make us more and more helpful and
ready. Waiting, for the praying Christian, is a gospel art.
