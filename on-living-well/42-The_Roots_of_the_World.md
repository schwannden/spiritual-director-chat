# The Roots of the World

ality, and let ourselves be intimidated by force and might, by horsepower and nuclear power, by money and militancy, and by terrorism and brutality
But there are times when even the newspapers report this truth
The real action in the world is rooted in words
Václav Havel sat in prison in Czechoslovakia for many years, because the communist government was
afraid of his words and what his words would do. Havel had little interest in politics and did not
write about politics. He was a deeply committed Christian who wrote plays for the stage and
letters to his wife.

Why would anyone consider him dangerous? Only because he wrote truth,
wrote well, and used words that were full of energy. But even though they imprisoned him,
they couldn't keep his words in the cell.

And then, nine months after we watched with astonishment
the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, he stepped out of prison and was immediately made
president of his country. In the speeches he made after that remarkable reversal, he spoke over and
over again to the Word, to the nature of the Word, to the Word of God, and the Word made flesh. But not all words are active.

Separated from the life of God, the Spirit of God, words are paltry. Words used without accuracy, without passion, and without love, are lifeless. It is not enough to
open our mouths and guess. It is not enough to make more or less articulate sounds come out of
our mouths.

Words that make and root the world, that bring truth into lives, and that ignite love
and hearts, are the words that are born in the presence of God. And that is why the Church ordains
men and women to this ministry of the Word. The single-minded task of these ministers of the Word
is to maintain the living connection, to be steeped in the silence of prayer, so that the Word of God
can be heard and answered, new every morning, fresh, again and again.

On work.
Work.
The Christian faith is physical.
