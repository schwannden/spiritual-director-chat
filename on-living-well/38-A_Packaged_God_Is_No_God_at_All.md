# A Packaged God Is No God at All

l.
This fact is not always easy to live with. Our tendency, most of the time, is to reduce God to the dimensions of our lives,
and make him the custodian of our comforts. We get a piece of the gospel that makes us feel good,
and we decide to specialize in that part, leaving out everything else.

We come across a few friends we like worshiping with,
and find ourselves guarding the coziness and excluding others. And then we open our Bibles and read these early experiences of God in the church, and
realize that we can't disregard others, not if we want to be a real church. We have to reach out, letting our lives be stretched with new challenges, new people,
and new experiences.
