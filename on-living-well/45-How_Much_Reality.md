# How Much Reality?

are we prepared for when following Jesus? A lot or little?
We can, it seems, get by on minimal reality,
supplementing it with large doses of fantasy and labeling the supplements Christian. But our alarm decreases when we examine the gospel stories carefully.

Jesus is always leading us into more. We can enter the real world.
