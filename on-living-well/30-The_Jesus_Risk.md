# The Jesus Risk

God on our side so that we will have security. But Jesus calls us to a life full of hazard. We enter into the act of worship and expose our lives to scripture and find something
far better than a sure thing.

We find a living Lord and an active faith full of unpredictability. William Stafford's poem, A Course in Creative Writing, contrasts what we consciously want
with what we get when we live in faith. They went to wilderness with a map, but how about errors
that give a new start?

Jesus' story is our training ground for living at risk, living
expectantly, and living with a lover who daily surprises us with grace.
