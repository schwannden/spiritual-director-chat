# What Do We Do?

he did
He told me in rapid-fire sentences for about 20 minutes
Reflecting on the meeting afterward, I realized that I still didn't know what he did, what he really did
I knew the number of meetings he set up, the large numbers of people he spoke to, and the impressive mileage that he logged in travel
But his language had been mostly cliché, so it was nearly impossible to pick up anything specific or distinctively personal
I ended up knowing a lot about his activities, but very little about him
About that conjunction of inner and outer that takes place in real work
That distillation of purpose and passion that gets expressed in this Christian way
I had anticipated a conversation with a potential friend
What I got was a presentation by a religious salesperson
I was disappointed. Then a friend told me a contrasting story. The same question was put to a person, busily at work.

What are you doing?
But instead of a job description, or a list of tasks and accomplishments, the quiet answer
was this. I'm changing the world. That is a St. Paul kind of answer. I'm changing the world.

It is also a church kind of answer. We're changing the world. I don't know if you have something quite that large in mind when you prepare to come to
worship. Maybe you just expect a little inspiration or solace.

Maybe you just want to get away for an hour or two from life's daily clutter, and be refreshed
by some beauty and sacred order. Maybe you are following an old habit. But, we are changing the world.
