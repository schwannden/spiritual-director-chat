# A Sudden Longing

is released and comes out into the open. While passing the time of day, we hear God's word spoken, and life is changed. Jesus did,
and does, this a lot. He finds us as we are, going about our work and thinking that God is
a million miles away, and engages us in conversations that change our lives.

There
is no style of life that exempts us from these meetings. There is no day of the week on which
may not happen, and there is no work that may not provide the scene or encounter.
