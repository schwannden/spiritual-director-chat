# On Growing

hen jesus was led up by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil
he fasted 40 days and 40 nights and afterwards he was famished matthew chapter 4 verses 1 to 2
it's hard to be a human being of all the creatures in this world we have the toughest task it is easy
to be a crocus no decisions to make no schedules to keep and no disappointments to endure the crocus
sleeps all winter and then as the snow recedes and the sun warms the earth the crocus breaks to
the ground with blossoms that bring standing applause from all of us it is easy to be a cat
No anxieties about aging, no perplexities about world affairs, and no guilt about real
or imagined adulteries. The cat grooms itself on the carpet, purrs on any convenient lap, and holds the opinions
of the servile humans in haughty disdain. But being human is not easy.

Not at all easy.
The seasons do not automatically develop us into maturity. Our instincts do not naturally guide us into a superior contentment. We falter and fail.
We doubt and question. We work and learn.
And just when we think we have it figured out, something else comes up that throws us
for a loop.

Jesus is the best look we have at what it means to be human. Really human.
We look at him and see the incredible attractiveness and profound wonder of being a woman or a man
We also see how difficult it is
We see him in contest against every force that would diminish us into something less than human
We see him confront and deal with every influence that would divert us from living to the glory of god
We get our basic orientation in the difficulties of being human by carefully attending to what jesus said and did in his 40 days
Of temptation and testing in the wilderness to become like him. We must be changed shaped and deepened by the word of god
