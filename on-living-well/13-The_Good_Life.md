# The Good Life

aunch daily into lucky lives. Lives of amazing grace, surprised by joy where they count blessings. They're not easy lives. They're not cozy lives. Christians go to work exploring and experiencing all the details of new life,
the Christ's birth, death and resurrection pour into them, through the Holy Spirit.

They're not explained lives, making need or perfect sense,
but they are good lives, robust with a goodness the Christians did not earn. Lucky
Editor's Note
Eugene's choice of the word lucky has the context of the Greek word makarios behind it. Eugene was particularly fond of this translation of the word,
often rendered blessed in English, as in the Beatitudes.

It does not refer to abstract probability, or a divine dice roll. Rather, it carries the everyday power of a child's exclamation, at some good fortune. Lucky.
Called to wholeness.
