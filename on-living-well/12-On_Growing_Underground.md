# On Growing Underground

church is a community, for the formation of human beings, made in the image of God,
into the stature of Christ. That formation is a complex process, with much of the action
invisible and silent. Much of what is visible and audible to us, is ill-formed and unsatisfying.

But remember, some seeds stay underground for years, before they germinate.
