# Shaping Belief

nificant thing about us. Our beliefs are far more important than our bank accounts, our reputations, or our schooling. Successful crooks have large bank accounts, undetected hypocrites have glowing reputations,
and highly educated people pursue evil ends.

Belief shapes character, results in behavior, and gives coherence to life. An animal can be described in terms of behavior and habitat, but only belief will account
for a human being. If we are concerned only with saving our own skin, have no awareness of God, or take no
responsibility regarding ancestors and descendants, we cannot be said to truly live as human beings
at all.

But the word belief is in poor repute. It has become tepid and murky, a dishwater word. James, dismayed by what happened to the worldly belief among Christians in the first century,
wrote in anger and dismay,
You believe that God is one, you do well.

Even the demons believe, and shudder. Chapter 2, verse 19. People in the community to which James wrote made proud assertions of belief in God, but
simultaneously treated the person that God created with cruelty and contempt.

In a single generation, they had brought a noble, robust word into disrepute. Belief, for them, was a religious emotion, a mere fluttering of the soul in the presence
of the sublime. But the emotion left no more impression on their lives than a footstep in the sand.

The next wave of emotion, of anger this time, of enthusiasm the next, wiped out all traces. Devils have emotions like that. Belief used as a synonym for emotion is meaningless, a dead word. True belief requires resurrection, a resurrection that comes through personal commitment to
Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.

Belief that doesn't involve personal commitment to God is meaningless, a frivolous emotion. Belief should be the all-involving act of our lives. What it involves us in is what God is doing. The center of the action is God.

He is creating and He is saving. He is blessing and He is preserving. The world is electric with meaning, fascinating in its beauty, alive with action, because
the God of creation is in action. Belief involves us in participation in God's action in the world.

It is a great waste and blasphemy when people are glib in the language of belief, but avoid
the everyday action of God. On Living It Up
Has life gone flat on you? Is the old zest
