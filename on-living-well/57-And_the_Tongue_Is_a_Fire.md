# And the Tongue Is a Fire

to 6
not long after we learn to speak the english language coherently we realize that a surprising
number of apparently grown-up people persist in using it to speak gibberish words are used with
total disregard for their meanings sentences are constructed that are out of touch with reality
speeches are made sermons preached books written and television talks given that on examination
turn out to be mainly nonsense. No subject is exempt, but religion seems to me to get more
than its fair share of this babble. Lies and blasphemies, ignorance and gossip, and malice
and hypocrisy permeate discourse on God, sin, and salvation with dismaying regularity.

There seems
to be no regard for truth or consequences. Because these speakers and writers appear to be backed
with evident wealth, carry themselves with competence, and sound so sincere, a biblically
uneducated public supposes that they know what they are talking about. Truth is at risk in the
world.

If we think the wrong things about God, we are disoriented in reality. If we believe
distorted presentations of the faith, our lives are deflected from God's best for us,
our perceptions of life blurred. We want to get it right.

The first century was no better than
this one, in this regard. It was the pastoral task of James then, as it is mine now, to do
something about it. Both how we speak and what we speak, especially when we are speaking about God,
requires solemn care.

If we do it badly, we do great damage. James pulled no punches. The tongue
is a fire. Chapter 3 verse 6. He knew how important it is to use words well, and how dangerous it is
to use them badly. We need all the help we can get to learn the truth, so that we will not be
taken in by those who are false to the truth.
