# On Square Pegs

the present age prepares roles for people and expects us to fit into them
these are roles in which we are asked to smoothly function as good consumers as indulgent hedonists
as proud owners as ruthless competitors as satisfied customers but there is a problem
christians don't fit people of faith have sharp awkward edges we are square pegs in round holes
society relentlessly whittles away at those sharp edges so that we will be well adjusted
profitable and safe the massive energies of journalism entertainment education and advertising
pour over us like a powerful, persistent flowing of water over rock, working to erode us into
smooth, secularized surfaces. We resist. We have been warned by Paul, don't let the world around
you squeeze you into its own mold, but let God remold your minds from within. Romans chapter 12,
verse 2, Phillips.

But how do we keep our recovered, original, sharp-edged identity as
Christians, in a world in which the pressures to conform are so powerful? Christians have long
agreed that our spiritual practices are the core technology for keeping the angle sharp. With
prayer and intention, we must encourage and direct the basic practices of faith to maintain our sharp
identity, as creatures a little less than God, against the world that is trying constantly to
adjust us into the comfortable mediocrity of being little more than animals.

Death, then life. A
