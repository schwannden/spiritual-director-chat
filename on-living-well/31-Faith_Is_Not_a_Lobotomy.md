# Faith Is Not a Lobotomy

to behave in moral ways by
reflex. The Christian faith does not lobotomize us so that we don't have to think through anything. Jesus said, learn from me, Matthew chapter 11 verse 29. He intends to shape our minds,
inform our intelligence, and mature our judgment so that we can understand and participate in the
meaning of new life.
