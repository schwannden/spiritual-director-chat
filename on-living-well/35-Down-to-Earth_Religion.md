# Down-to-Earth Religion

widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world. James chapter 1, verse 27. I was visiting with several friends once,
who were talking about how we had entered the faith, and found ourselves in relation with
Jesus Christ.

One of my friends, in the course of affirming how personal Jesus was to him,
quite vehemently protested, but I am not religious. He repeated the denial a couple of times to make
sure we got it. We got it. Religious is a negative word for a lot of people.

I think I understand
why. For many, religious means fussing around with words and manners and petty half-important
projects. It means a safe and harmless thing that I once heard called kitchen religion,
and has nothing to do with the words that came crashing down from Sinai or the blood
that poured off Golgotha.

It is an old problem, this trivialization of God and the gospel,
and needs to be faced and fought continuously. In the first-generation church, the fight
was led by James. He wrote a letter, circulated through the first-century congregation, in
which he said, like my friend the other evening, I am not religious.

Paraphrasing, see James
chapter 1 verse 26. He took the word religion, which was getting a bad reputation in the
world, shook it out, scrubbed it up, and restored it to its glorious and exhilarating original. We must return to the basics of life together in Christ.

We must clear the ground and make sure we are starting our journeys on the right foot. We must rediscover a better religion.
