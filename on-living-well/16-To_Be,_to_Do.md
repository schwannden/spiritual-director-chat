# To Be, to Do

e the two great gifts of God, the foundations of every other gift. We need to return to these two great capacities again and again, and cultivate them. The events of daily life need to be placed in perspective, by a deep sense of prayer,
by learning how to be before God.

Then, as reality closes in on us, we will perceive each event as
the working of the Holy Spirit, carefully designed for our particular needs. Every event is a touch
of the living finger of God, which is sketching in us, body, soul, and spirit, the true image of
his Son, which the Father originally gave to us, and is restoring.
