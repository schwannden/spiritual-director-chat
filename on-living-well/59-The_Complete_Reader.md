# The Complete Reader

be complete equipped for every good work second timothy chapter 3 verses 16 to 17 revised standard version the word complete artios means skillfully put together not thrown together haphazardly but carefully crafted there are people in woodworking shops who compensate for their lack of skill in carpentry by using a lot of nails and there are people lacking skill in living who try to keep their lives together with a lot of foreign matter drugs
hobbies, money, diversions, and fads. But the skillful reading of Scripture is the means that
God provides to put us together in the right way so that we are complete. It's what he uses to
shape, correct, and train us as human beings with dignity and eternity, rather than as conditioned
consumers salivating at every commercial or as bundles of animal sensations enslaved to impulses
of greed or lust or violence.

There are wrong ways to read Scripture, and Scripture is often
read wrongly. Reading Scripture academically is only interesting. Reading Scripture superstitiously
is merely silly. Scripture must be read devoutly, so God's Word will craft us from the inside out,
shaping our awkward, ill-formed lives until we are complete, equipped for every good work.

When we read Scripture devoutly, we deepen and extend our involvement in the conversation that
God has with us. We become more at home with His ways of working and more familiar with the way
His mind works. When we read Scripture devoutly, we are listening to God speak to us.

His Word
addresses the centers of our beings and calls forth responses that complete our lives into wholeness.
