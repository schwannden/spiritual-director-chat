# The Struggle Makes Sense

now better explanations of what's wrong with the world than anybody else, but
I can bear witness that people can experience the deepest kind of humiliation and rejection,
and still have life make sense finally, because God worked in them. I can bear witness that
the suffering that Jesus experienced and confronted didn't produce a morose, depressed man, but
rather resulted in the gospel, the good news. And I can bear witness that when I share the
sufferings of others and confront the despair of life, I find another power working in me,
the grace of Jesus Christ, that puts things together again in a way that feels strangely
like joy.

Part 2. On Simplicity. I'm not saying that I have this all together, that I have it
made, but I am well on my way, reaching out for Christ, who has so wondrously reached out for me. Friends, don't get me wrong.

By no means do I count myself an expert in all of this,
but I've got my eye on the goal, for God is beckoning us onward, to Jesus. I'm off and
running, and I'm not turning back. Philippians, chapter 3, verses 12-14.

The Message.
A Welcoming. God comes to us.
