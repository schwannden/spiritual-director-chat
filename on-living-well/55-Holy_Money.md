# Holy Money

is
holy tithing is the ancient and biblical practice that puts into action the conviction that all
money is holy it is an offering of the first fruits of our labor to the god who made this
world of soil and rock barley and grapes silver and gold and tin up to and including embossed
plastic credit cards the tie that traditionally is a decision to offer god the first 10 of what
we acquire through our labor it is based on the conviction that we would have gotten nothing from
all our sweat and exertion, if God had not first given us grounds to use, muscles to work, brains
to think, and communities to live in and be employed in, we work with materials already given to us. We maintain our true relation to our work and its results, when our first action is to give,
in the name of our Lord. If we do not begin with giving, and giving substantially,
10% is traditional, and for most of us substantial.

We inevitably become dominated by the spirit of
acquisition. Getting and getting and getting. We become obsessed with keeping control of what we
have. We scheme and covet. And in so doing, we profane our money.

We violate the holiness of
our money. Money offered freely to Christ is given back to us changed in some deep and interior way. It can change us and the world around us. Generosity is our most reliable and useful
means for turning what we have into a gift.

The act of tithing is like leaven. All our money gets
infected with the spirit of generosity and enjoyment. The tithe pulls all our possessions
into lives of adoration and celebration. But I must also warn you that the practice of tithing
is dangerous.

Jesus's angriest words were directed to scrupulous tithers. Tithing can subtly feed
pride. It can create a snobbish elitism. It can fuel a censorious spirit that criticizes others. It can develop into self-righteousness that assumes that God is now obligated to take
special notice.
