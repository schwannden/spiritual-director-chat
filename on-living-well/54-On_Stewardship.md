# On Stewardship

iding the topic
he talked about money more than most other subjects there is not a word in his teaching
that justifies the belittling of possessions but he warned of the perils involved in getting money
in keeping in hoarding and he spoke of giving money always he stressed the importance of making
money as a means to an end and not an end in itself he recognized that it can be a great
servant of humankind but that there is always a danger that it may become a person's master
Many have started out to get money, and have found that money has gotten them. The Church has summarized its thinking on money under the word stewardship. Stewards are people who manage and take care of someone else's goods and possessions.

They own nothing themselves. They work for someone else, making decisions and carrying out plans and programs in the
best interests of the owner. That is what Jesus said we are, stewards. God is the owner.
The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.

Psalm 24, verse 1.
Revised Standard Version. In other words, everything that is, is God's. The natural world, the world of people, the world of things, the world of the Spirit,
it. The earth is the Lord's.

Nothing that exists is exempt from the claim of God's ownership. And we are placed here as stewards of this earth. It is false and arrogant to say that any of it is
our own. It has been put in trust to us.

We have received it to enjoy it, to use it, to increase it,
and to distribute it. But God is still the owner. We only manage his resources,
taking care of the life and goods that he has given.
