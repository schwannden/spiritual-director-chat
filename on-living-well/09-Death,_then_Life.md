# Death, then Life

e. This death
is not primarily biological, although it will eventually include that. Jesus is leading us to
the death of illusions, and illusions die hard. Jesus is leading us to the death of self-will,
and self-will is a stubborn survivor.

Jesus is leading us to the death of sin, and sin is a cat
with nine lives. Jesus is leading us to the Lenten death. It will catapult us into the Easter
resurrection.
