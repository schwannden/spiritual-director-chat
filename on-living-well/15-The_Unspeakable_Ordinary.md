e more spiritual by becoming less material. The life of faith takes place
where there are rocks and water. We do not become more Christian by becoming less American
or Italian or Norwegian. We do not become more faithful by becoming less a man or woman
or youth or child.

and commerce and government. Realizing the unspeakable ordinariness of the life of faith
is powerful.
