# Leap, Live, Love

m the visible uncertainties of self, to the invisible certainties of faith. To live intensely instead of eagerly and dully, and to love directly and personally, and not
secondhand. Each person, says the gospel, is called to leap in faith, to live as his or her
own authentic and personal being, and to love, perhaps for the first time, intimately.

Christ
shows us in his own life how to do this in a way that does not require us to curb our own uniqueness,
joy, or excellence. Rather, it is expanded.
