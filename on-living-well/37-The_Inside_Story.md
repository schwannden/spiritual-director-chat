# The Inside Story

the God story, that is at the heart of everything. Prayer grants access to inwardness, to the God action that is taking place within us. This God action is the most distinctive thing about us. It is more important than our circulatory systems, our brainwaves, and our skeletal
structures.

When we realize that huge centrality, we are no longer content with prayers that are brief
and occasional expressions of thanks or general laments upward. We want something comprehensive. Prayer that is rigorously probing, and capable of getting at the entire inside stories of our lives.
