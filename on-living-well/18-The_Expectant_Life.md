# The Expectant Life

preme Christian function, and the most distinctive characteristic
of our religion. Christians should live on tiptoe, alert, joyful, affirmative, wide-eyed, ready. What are we looking forward to? In a word, God.
We know that God comes.

It is his most characteristic motion. He doesn't leave.
He doesn't wander off. He comes, to us, his people. In expectation of Christ, we should prepare ourselves to participate wholeheartedly in
God's next move.

We have a choice to make. Will we live slovenly, with unbuttoned mind and disheveled spirit, thoughtlessly supposing
that the same things are monotonously repeated over and over in creation and history? Or will we live alertly and ardently, convinced that God still comes and speaks?

The expectant command is for us to awaken. Our mission is to develop lives that connect what God did in the past with what he will
do in the future. Will we live in spasms and jerks, in fits and starts, in fads and fashions?

Or will we live coherently and organically, believing that God will complete what he has
begun? The expectant command is for us to love. We ought to cultivate the skills that equip us to live in cheerful anticipation of what
God will do tomorrow.

Will we live anxiously, complaining and querulous because we don't have all we want, or because
we don't know what is coming next? Or will we live in confident joy, sure that God's next move will be a good one? The expectant command is for us to rejoice.
