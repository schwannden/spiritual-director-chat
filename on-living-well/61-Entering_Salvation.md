# Entering Salvation

our religious language that it is a cliche but it refers to action that exceeds our
comprehension even as it invites our participation we need to return to the word with fresh attention
with lively curiosity over and over again and discover anew the central action of the universe
jesus is ready to save he says many true things and he does many right things but he's hidden or
not-so-hidden agenda that gives order and goal to all the details is salvation. The consequence for
us who name the name of Jesus and who assemble regularly to worship him is that we must be
prepared to enter into his act of salvation. We cannot take a word of Jesus here and think on it
for a few minutes, then admire an act there.

This is a world-determining and life-transforming
person we are involved with. No detail of our lives is exempt from his energetic, eternal work.
