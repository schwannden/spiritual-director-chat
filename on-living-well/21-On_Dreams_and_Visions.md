# On Dreams and Visions

usually see dreams and visions
are means of seeing the reality that is inaccessible to our senses we use microscopes to see the very
small we use telescopes to see the very far away and we use dreams and visions to see the truth
there are strong forces around us that externalize us that diminish the rich interiors of our lives
and reduce us to what we can see and pick up and buy that is the world's work that is sin's work
we define ourselves by what we can put on a job description god gives us dreams and visions so
that we have access to the whole thing the world for which christ died the whole person in whom
Christ lives. Think of some of the stories in the Bible. Abraham's vision, Jacob's dream,
Balaam's vision, Solomon's dream, Mary's vision, and Joseph's dream.

Every time we read of one of
these dreams or visions, a life deepens and the world changes. Do you expect it would be different
for us? Visions are essential in life. Leap, live, love.
