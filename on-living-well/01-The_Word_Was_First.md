# The Word Was First

the word was previous to everything else before we were conceived and took shape in our mother's
before we were born before anything happened there was the word before there was a sun or a
moon or stars there was the word before there were trees and flowers and fish there was the word
before there were governments and hospitals and schools there was the word if the word were not
first, everything would have gone awry. If the Word were second, or third, or fourth, we would
have lost touch with the deep, divine rhythms of creation. If the Word were pushed out of the way,
and made to be a servant to the action and program, we would have lost connection with
the vast interior springs of redemption that flow out of our Lord, the Word made flesh.

When the Word is treated casually or carelessly, we wander away from the essential,
personal intimacies that God creates by His Word.
