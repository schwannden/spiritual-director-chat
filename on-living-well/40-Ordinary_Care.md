# Ordinary Care

ts and pains, sorrows and disappointments, despair and grief, confusion and dismay
Speaking words of encouragement, binding up wounds, giving direction, sharing trouble
When we are doing these things, we are being fully human
We never feel shamed or guilty or mean when we do such things
We don't always do them well, and sometimes we do them badly
Caring for others requires skill and stamina, intelligence and discipline
It is not something we can do occasionally when we feel a gush of sentiment
Life together as people of God is, among other things, training and caring for others
We cannot be fully human if we do not do this
We cannot enjoy and delight in the gospel if we do not do this
And so we refuse to quit caring when our caring is flawed
We refuse to pass the buck for caring to others. We commit ourselves to a lifelong apprenticeship in the practice of caring for others. The letter to the Hebrews includes a succinct text to keep us attentive to this feature
of life together.

Let mutual love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that, some have entertained angels
without knowing it. Chapter 13, verses 1-2. The text brings to mind a story. Abraham at the Oaks of Mamre.

See Genesis chapter 18, verses 1-8. Abraham towers in our regard as the one for whom God was everything. He lived in a vast, soaring, splendid world of grace. He believed.
That is why he is important to us.

He has evidenced that we are totally alive only when we live by faith in god, but there is a less publicized side to abraham
He cared for others skillfully
A passionate concern for god didn't render him indifferent to people
One day three men showed up at his tent and abraham greeted them and invited them to stay for a meal
He did not treat them as interruptions to his prayers or as intrusions on his pilgrimage
The spontaneity of abraham's hospitality shows that it was part and parcel of his faith
It seems he treated everyone that way. He didn't know that the men were angels
According to c. s. Lewis. There are no ordinary people next to the blessed sacrament itself
Your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses
Caring begins in the ordinary.

Caring doesn't mean dramatic intervention. Rather, it develops out of the routine courtesies, meal shared, greetings exchanged, silences
accented, and affirmations ventured. We don't all do the same things.

We don't all have the same gifts. Skillful caring is fashioned out of the natural circumstances of life, with whoever happens
to be there. We don't have to be in extraordinary happenings with conspicuous gifts, faced with overwhelming
needs.

Abraham in front of his tent. A hastily prepared meal. Angels, unawares.
What do we do? Once I had a conversation with a new acquaintance.
