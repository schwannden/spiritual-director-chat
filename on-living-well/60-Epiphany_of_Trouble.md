# Epiphany of Trouble

myself when i am in trouble i do things better i can remember the exact place where the statement
was made my friend and i were coming out of a subway station at 57th street in new york city
it was a summer night i don't now remember what his particular trouble was only his statement
about the effect it had on him since then i've kept my eyes and ears open most people are not
as ingenuously honest as my friend during that little epiphany, but I am convinced that many
share his preference. A crisis gives us the stimulus to live at our best. Trouble forces
us to gather our energy.

We are standing around bored, wondering what to do with our lives,
and then something takes place—war, accident, death, rejection, or danger—that removes all
the ambiguity and wipes out the boredom. Then suddenly we are alert and excited, alive. God is commonly understood as the extra help we need to deal with the trouble in our lives—sickness,
loss, disappointment, failure, or guilt.

There is no question but that He is. Christ began His
work in acts of healing, helping, and delivering. But after we are healed, what do we do? After we
are forgiven, what do we do? Let me put this in personal terms as your pastor.

When someone is
sick, I know what to do. When there is a death in someone's family, I know what to do. When someone
comes to me with a sense of guilt, I know what to do. But most of you, most of the time, are not
sick or grieving or failing.

Most of the congregation, most of the time, is getting on fairly
well, thank you. They're getting to work on time, making the mortgage payments, staying on speaking
terms with the neighbors, and eating three fairly decent meals a day. What do I do with you during
these times, do I wait around for the next emergency?

Maybe if I do a really good job on
Sundays teaching you the moral discipline so that you will stay out of trouble, I won't have to work
so hard during the week. Or is there something else? Many people find a decent, comfortable life
like that intolerable, so they create trouble just to keep the action going.

They quarrel or they get
sick or they precipitate an accident. Then they are not bored anymore. Then they have a reason
for living. There is pain in that, of course, but the pain is preferable to the meaningless routine.

I heard once that one of the startling things found in a study of Great Britain during World
War II was that during the Nazi bombing of London, nearly all the citizens' psychological neuroses
disappeared. People didn't have time to be emotionally disturbed, they were in deadly
trouble, and they had to do something about it. Editors note. This anecdote should not be taken
as a wide dismissal of mental health conditions or treatments by Eugene, who deeply respected the
unique contributions of psychology and clinical counseling, and encouraged Christians to do the
same.

His point in context is to discourage a kind of co-dependency sometimes found in Christian
preaching. After all, if faith is founded as merely a response to spiritual crisis, how genuine can it
be in the everyday? I also once heard an amusing but apparently true story of a woman who was
paralyzed and couldn't leave her bed.

She was wealthy and could command physicians and counselors
to come to her. Nothing helped. Her condition became a great puzzle to her physician and
psychiatrist. One day in desperation, the physician and psychiatrist conspired to bring about her
healing.

They had a friend make a fire in a safe place, which sent out great billows of smoke
through the house, and then yell, fire, fire. The two doctors were in the room with the woman at
the time, and ran out as if for their lives, leaving her helpless in the bed behind them,
and waited outside. In a few minutes, she came running out after them.

Surely a terrible practice. But there are preachers who do that too. They yell fire and brimstone to mobilize in people
the healthy response of repentance. And of course it works. Some of the time. The problem is that I
have to come back to this pulpit every week.

And while it is true that we are living in crisis all
the time, that we do not know the hour of our death, and that judgment may intervene at the
least expected time, there is far more to life than dealing with crises. But here is the question. How do we live at our best when we don't have to?
