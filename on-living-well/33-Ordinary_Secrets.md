# Ordinary Secrets

ord that
created the heavens and arranges the seasons enters ordinary lives and fashions eternal life
in them is truly extraordinary. And isn't it extraordinary that these ordinary lives that
are radically transformed by grace continue to appear so ordinary? A man who has spent 52 years
making a mess of his life, encounters the living God in Jesus Christ, believes and obeys, and
becomes an absolutely new creature.

Everything has changed from the inside out, from top to bottom. But when he gets out of bed the next day and walks out into the street, he is still 5 feet 7,
weighs 164 pounds, and has H-bots on the backs of his hands and a cut on his jaw from too hasty
shaving. And when he talks, he pronounces his words in a way that indicates he was born and
raised in Texas.

To everyone who sees and listens to him, he looks and sounds the same. Is someone keeping a secret? A woman who has lived selfishly and indulgently for 32 years
encounters the living God in Jesus Christ, believes and obeys, and becomes an absolutely
new creature.

She begins to love extravagantly, to forgive and to serve. But when she looks in
the mirror the next day, she still sees one chin more than she would prefer, the onset of crow's
feet at the edges of her eyes, and gray hairs that she has been distressed at seeing recently. When she walks into the kitchen, she moves with the same, slightly pigeon-toed gait that her
friends have kidded her about for most of her life.

What is all this about being a new creature,
she wonders. Is there some secret ingredient? One of the extraordinary things about Jesus was
that he unassumingly took his place among the ordinary men and women around him.

Even after
his resurrection, he appeared ordinary. Mary at the tomb looked at him and thought he was the
gardener. See John chapter 20 verse 15. Two disciples on the Emmaus road thought he was
just another traveler.

See Luke chapter 24 verses 28 to 29. The disciples, fishing on the sea of
Galilee, didn't recognize him on the shore, see John chapter 21, verses 1 to 4. Hundreds of people
saw him walking along the roads, and heard him talking to his friends and family, and had no
idea that God was in him, among them.

Why the secrecy? He didn't make it easy for us to see
God in him. But there were occasional and brief moments when the glory broke through blazingly,
and recognition was immediate. The baptism was one of these moments, the transfiguration another.

These moments, despite the ordinary secrecy, continued to occur.
