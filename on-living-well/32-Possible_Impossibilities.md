# Possible Impossibilities

in his teaching and parables. What is he talking about anyway, we
think? Is this airhead preaching? Isn't religion supposed to make us well-adjusted citizens? Doesn't God want us to live moderately and serenely?

But every time we return to the
gospel records and read again exactly what is there, we realize afresh how much of what Jesus
said doesn't fit at all into what we think of as a normal life. And we realize how habitually we
reduce his words to what fits into what we call the real world. Our so-called real world is real
enough, but it is a much reduced world, a gray world, a flat earth world.

Jesus's words bring
us the news of an expanded world, a bright world, a full-dimensioned world. A world in which God
rules, mercy is a common experience, and love is the daily working agenda, not an occasional
romantic interlude. Jesus' words orient us to the world that is changed from the inside out by his
arrival and rule.
